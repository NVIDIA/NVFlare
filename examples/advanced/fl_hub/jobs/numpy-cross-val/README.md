# Hello Numpy Scatter and Gather

"[Scatter and Gather](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.app_common.workflows.scatter_and_gather.html)" is the standard workflow to implement Federated Averaging ([FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629)). 
This workflow follows the hub and spoke model for communicating the global model to each client for local training (i.e., "scattering") and aggregates the result to perform the global model update (i.e., "gathering").  

> **_NOTE:_** This example uses a Numpy-based trainer and will generate its data within the code.
