    "## Introduction to GNN, Tasks, and federated GNN via Inductive Learning\n",
    "### GNN\n",
    "This example shows how to train a classification model using Graph Neural Network (GNN) using a modern **recipe-based approach**. GNNs show a promising future in research and industry, with potential applications in various domains, including social networks, e-commerce, recommendation systems, and more.\n",
    "GNNs excel in learning, modeling, and leveraging complex relationships within graph-structured data. They combine local and global information, incorporate structural knowledge, adapt to diverse tasks, handle heterogeneous data, support transfer learning, scale for large graphs, offer interpretable insights, and achieve impressive performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "In this example, we provide two tasks:\n",
    "1. **Protein Classification**:\n",
    "The aim is to classify protein roles based on their cellular functions from gene ontology. The dataset we are using is PPI\n",
    "([protein-protein interaction](http://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/#code)) graphs, where each graph represents a specific human tissue. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) dataset is commonly used in graph-based machine-learning tasks, especially in the field of bioinformatics. This dataset represents interactions between proteins as graphs, where nodes represent proteins and edges represent interactions between them.\n",
    "2. **Financial Transaction Classification**:\n",
    "The aim is to classify whether a given transaction is licit or illicit. For this financial application, we use the [Elliptic++](https://github.com/git-disl/EllipticPlusPlus) dataset. It consists of 203k Bitcoin transactions and 822k wallet addresses to enable both the detection of fraudulent transactions and the detection of illicit addresses (actors) in the Bitcoin network by leveraging graph data. For more details, please refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06108.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Federated GNN via Inductive Learning with FedAvgRecipe\n",
    "Both tasks are for node classification. We used the inductive representation learning method [GraphSAGE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf) based on [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)'s examples. \n",
    "[Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  is  a library built upon PyTorch to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for a wide range of applications related to structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For protein classification task, we used it in an unsupervised manner, following [PyG's unsupervised PPI example](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/graph_sage_unsup_ppi.py).\n",
    "For financial transaction classification task, we used it in a supervised manner, directly using the node labels with supervised classification loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the inductive learning mode is being used, the locally learnt model (a representation encoding / classification network) is irrelevant to the candidate graph, we are able to use the basic [FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) as the federated learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses **NVFlare's FedAvgRecipe** to create federated GNN training jobs, providing a cleaner, more programmatic API compared to traditional job templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we list steps to run this example."
