# Secure Federated XGBoost with Homomorphic Encryption
This example illustrates the use of NVIDIA FLARE enabling secure federated [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) under both horizontal and vertical collaborations.
The examples are based on a [finance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) to perform fraud detection.

## Secure Federated Training of XGBoost
Several mechanisms have been proposed for training an XGBoost model in a federated learning setting, e.g. [vertical, histogram-based horizontal, and tree-based horizontal](../fedxgb/README.md). 

In this example, we further extend the existing horizontal and vertical federated learning approaches to support secure federated learning using homomorphic encryption. Depending on the characteristics of the data to be encrypted, we can choose between [CKKS](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL) and [Paillier](https://github.com/intel/pailliercryptolib_python).

In the following, we illustrate both *horizontal* and *vertical* federated XGBoost, *without* and *with* homomorphic encryption.
Please refer to our [documentation](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/user_guide/federated_xgboost/secure_xgboost_user_guide.html) for more details on the pipeline design and the encryption logic.

## Requirements
To be able to run all the examples, please install the requirements first from the main folder.

## Encryption Plugins
The secure XGBoost requires encryption plugins to work. From 2.6, we no longer distributed the plugins with NVFlare package. 
Please build the plugins following the instructions in this [README](../../../../integration/xgboost/encryption_plugins/README.md)

> **_NOTE:_** Please make sure to use the correct versions of the required libraries, including CUDA driver and runtime.
> The 'How to run XGBoost with encryption plugins' section is not needed for running Secure Federated XGBoost in simulator mode.

The build process will generate 2 .so files: libcuda_paillier.so and libnvflare.so. 

To use libnvflare.so plugin, the [IPCL](https://github.com/intel/pailliercryptolib_python) library installation is needed, 
and we recommend install it from source.

## Key Checkups
Before we move on to the next step, we want to double-check if we have properly set up our environments:
1. Check the XGBoost version, should be 2.2.0.dev as the version in the requirements.txt.
2. Check the path of the encryption plugins, which will be used in the next step.
3. Check the installation of `ipcl-python` for libnvflare.so plugin.

## Data Preparation
### Download and Store Data
To run the examples, we first download the dataset from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which is a single `.csv` file.
By default, we assume the dataset is downloaded, uncompressed, and stored in `/tmp/nvflare/dataset/creditcard.csv`.

> **_NOTE:_** If the dataset is downloaded in another place,
> make sure to modify the corresponding `DATASET_PATH` inside `prepare_data.sh`.

### Data Split
To prepare data for further experiments, we perform the following steps:
1. Split the dataset into training/validation and testing sets. 
2. Split the training/validation set: 
    * Into "train" and "valid" for baseline centralized training.
    * Into "train" and "valid" for each client under horizontal setting. 
    * Into "train" and "valid" for each client under vertical setting.

Data splits used in this example can be generated with
```
bash prepare_data.sh
```

This will generate data splits for 3 clients under all experimental settings.

> **_NOTE:_** In this example, we have divided the dataset into separate columns for each site,
> assuming that the datasets from different sites have already been joined using Private Set
> Intersection (PSI). However, in practice, each site initially has its own separate dataset. To
> combine these datasets accurately, you need to use PSI to match records with the same ID across
> different sites. For more information on how to perform PSI, please refer to the 
> [PSI example](../../../../examples/advanced/psi).


> **_NOTE:_** The generated data files will be stored in the folder `/tmp/nvflare/xgb_dataset/`,
> and will be used by jobs by specifying the path within `config_fed_client`

## Run Baseline and Standalone Experiments
First, we run the baseline centralized training and standalone federated XGBoost training for comparison.
In this case, we utilized the `mock` plugin to simulate the homomorphic encryption process. 

To run all experiments, we provide a script for all settings.
```
bash run_training_standalone.sh
```
This will cover baseline centralized training, federated xgboost run in the same machine
(server and clients are running in different processes) with and without secure feature.

> **_NOTE:_** In this example, we use the `mock` plugin to simulate the homomorphic encryption process.
> The actual encyption plugin will be used in the next step.

## Federated Experiments with NVFlare
We then run the federated XGBoost training using NVFlare Simulator via [JobAPI](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/fed_job_api.html), without and with homomorphic encryption.
The running time of each job depends mainly on the encryption workload. 

Assuming we use libnvflare.so plugin located in `/tmp/nvflare/plugins/libnvflare.so`, to run vertical simulations, we have  

```
python xgb_fl_job.py --data_root /tmp/nvflare/dataset/xgb_dataset/vertical_xgb_data --data_split_mode vertical
NVFLARE_XGB_PLUGIN_NAME=nvflare NVFLARE_XGB_PLUGIN_PATH=/tmp/nvflare/plugins/libnvflare.so python xgb_fl_job.py --data_root /tmp/nvflare/dataset/xgb_dataset/vertical_xgb_data --data_split_mode vertical --secure
```

To run horizontal simulations, we have

```
python xgb_fl_job.py --data_root /tmp/nvflare/dataset/xgb_dataset/horizontal_xgb_data --data_split_mode horizontal
python xgb_fl_job.py --data_root /tmp/nvflare/dataset/xgb_dataset/horizontal_xgb_data --data_split_mode horizontal --secure
```

In this case, the secure horizontal job will need two steps: job preparation from above, and secure context preparation following below:

As secure aggregation is performed on the server-side, to support this, additional tenseal context must be provisioned before starting the job to prepare the server. In contrast, the secure vertical scheme doesn't require this step because the server's role is limited to message routing, without performing the actual secure message aggregation.

To enable this, we have implemented the nvflare.lighter.impl.he.HEBuilder, which is included in the prepared project.yml. You can provision the server by running the following commands:

```
jobdir=/tmp/nvflare/workspace/fedxgb_secure/train_fl/jobs/horizontal_secure
workdir=/tmp/nvflare/workspace/fedxgb_secure/train_fl/works/horizontal_secure
nvflare provision -p project.yml -w ${workdir}
nvflare simulator ${jobdir} -w ${workdir}/example_project/prod_00/site-1 -n 3 -t 3
```

> **_NOTE:_** From the running logs, you will see multiple `has_encrypted_data=None` and `Not secure content - ignore` messages.
> These are expected because under the hood of XGBoost, there are multiple operations 
> relying on the same "broadcast", "all_reduce", "all_gather" MPI calls - some requires
> encryption (e.g. those related to gh gradient pairs), and others do not (e.g. collecting
> the total feature slot number from clients). 
> 
> In our plugin implementation, we have a logic to recognize whether the payload needs 
> to be handled with encryption. Therefore, the log can have `not for gh broadcast - ignore`, 
> meaning the current message does not need to be taken care of by encryption, and 
> will be passed on to XGBoost inner logic directly.
> 
> But if you do not see any `has_encrypted_gh=True`, the secure plugin is not functioning properly.
> Please check the debug logs to find out the reason.

## Results
Comparing the AUC results with centralized baseline, we have four observations:
1. The performance of the model trained with homomorphic encryption is identical to its counterpart without encryption.
2. Vertical federated learning (both secure and non-secure) have identical performance as the centralized baseline.
3. Horizontal federated learning (both secure and non-secure) have performance slightly different from the centralized baseline. This is because under horizontal FL, the local histogram quantiles are based on the local data distribution, which may not be the same as the global distribution.
4. GPU leads to different results compared to CPU, which is expected as the GPU involves some data conversions.

Below are sample results for CPU training:

The AUC of vertical learning (both secure and non-secure):
```
[0]	eval-auc:0.90515	train-auc:0.92747
[1]	eval-auc:0.90516	train-auc:0.92748
[2]	eval-auc:0.90518	train-auc:0.92749
```
The AUC of horizontal learning (both secure and non-secure):
```
[0]	eval-auc:0.89789	train-auc:0.92732
[1]	eval-auc:0.89791	train-auc:0.92733
[2]	eval-auc:0.89791	train-auc:0.92733
```

Comparing the tree models with centralized baseline, we have the following observations:
1. Vertical federated learning (non-secure) has exactly the same tree model as the centralized baseline.
2. Vertical federated learning (secure) has the same tree structures as the centralized baseline, however, it produces different tree records at different parties - because each party holds different feature subsets, as illustrated below.
3. Horizontal federated learning (both secure and non-secure) have different tree models from the centralized baseline.

|     ![Tree Structures](./figs/tree.base.png)      |
|:-------------------------------------------------:|
|                 *Baseline Model*                  |
| ![Tree Structures](./figs/tree.vert.secure.0.png) |
|        *Secure Vertical Model at Party 0*         |
| ![Tree Structures](./figs/tree.vert.secure.1.png) |
|        *Secure Vertical Model at Party 1*         |
| ![Tree Structures](./figs/tree.vert.secure.2.png) |
|        *Secure Vertical Model at Party 2*         |

In this case we can notice that Party 0 holds Feature 7 and 10, Party 1 holds Feature 14, 17, and 12, and Party 2 holds none of the effective features for this tree - parties who do not hold the feature will and should not know the split value if it.

By combining the feature splits at all parties, the tree structures will be identical to the centralized baseline model.

When comparing the training and validation accuracy as well as the model outputs,
experiments conducted with NVFlare produce results that are identical
to those obtained from standalone scripts.
