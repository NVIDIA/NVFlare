    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Tree-based Collaboration\n",
    "Under tree-based collaboration, individual trees are independently trained on each client's local data without aggregating the global sample gradient histogram information.\n",
    "Trained trees are collected and passed to the server / other clients for aggregation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bagging Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bagging XGBoost\" is one way of performing tree-based federated boosting with multiple sites: at each round of tree boosting, all sites start from the same \"global model\", and boost a number of trees (in current example, 1 tree) based on their local data. The resulting trees are then send to server. A bagging aggregation scheme is applied to all the submitted trees to update the global model, which is further distributed to all clients for next round's boosting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This scheme bears certain similarity to the [Random Forest mode](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/rf.html) of XGBoost, where a `num_parallel_tree` is boosted based on random row/col splits, rather than a single tree. Under federated learning setting, such split is fixed to clients rather than random and without column subsampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to basic uniform shrinkage setting where all clients have the same learning rate, based on our research, we enabled scaled shrinkage across clients for weighted aggregation according to each client's data size, which is shown to significantly improve the model's performance on non-uniform quantity splits over HIGGS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we listed steps to run this example."
