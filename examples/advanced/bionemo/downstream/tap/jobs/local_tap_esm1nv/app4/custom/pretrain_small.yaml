    modify_percent: 0.15 # Fraction of characters in a protein sequence to modify. (Modification means replacing with another amino acid or with a mask token)
    perturb_percent: 0.1 # Of the modify_percent, what fraction of characters are to be replaced with another amino acid.
    mask_percent: 0.8 # Of the modify_percent, what fraction of characters are to be replaced with a mask token.
    identity_percent: 0.1 # Of the modify_percent, what fraction of characters are to be unchanged as the original amino acid.
