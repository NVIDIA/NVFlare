# NVFlare PSI for user email matching

## How to use FLARE PSI operator ?

For User ids matching, the usage is really simple. 

* Step 1: user needs to implement the PSI interface where the client side's items need to be loaded.
These items could be user_ids or feature names depending on your use case.

* Step 2: Specify the job configurations

**Client Config**

```
{
  "format_version": 2,
  "executors": [
    {
      "tasks": [
        "PSI"
      ],
      "executor": {
        "id": "Executor",
        "name": "PSIExecutor",
        "args": {
          "psi_algo_id": "dh_psi"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "dh_psi",
      "name": "DhPSITaskHandler",
      "args": {
        "local_psi_id": "local_psi"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "local_psi",
      "path": "local_psi.LocalPSI",
      "args": {
        "psi_writer_id": "psi_writer"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "psi_writer",
      "name": "FilePSIWriter",
      "args": {
        "output_path": "psi/intersection.txt"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Here we specify the following components:

* **_PSIExecutor_** : this is the built-in FLARE PSIExecutor. 
* **_local_psi_** : local PSI component is the component user needs to write, here we called it "local_psi". 
the local psi component require PSIWriter, so can one save the resulting intersect to storage. here we implemented
a file writer
* **_FilePSIWriter_** : save the intersection to a file in workspace.  

**Server Config**

Just specify the built-in PSI controller. 
```
{
  "format_version": 2,
  "workflows": [
    {
      "id": "controller",
      "name": "DhPSIController",
      "args": {
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
**Code**
 the code is really trivial just needs to implement one method in PSI interface

```
class LocalPSI(PSI):
    def load_items(self) -> List[str]:
        pass

```

## Run PSI job in Simulator

### User_email_match 
   in this example, we generated some random emails addresses in three sites. 
   you need to copy the data to tmp location first. 

**prepare data**

change to the PSI example directory
```
cd NVFlare/examples/advanced/psi/
```
We have already prepared some random fake emails as data, all we need to copy this dat to a location 
that used by the data loading code, we have specified "/tmp/nvflare/psi" in our sample code, so we copy the data to
"/tmp/nvflare/psi" directory

```
user_email_match/prepare_data.sh
```   
You will see something like the followings

```
copy NVFlare/examples/advanced/psi/user_email_match/data to /tmp/nvflare/psi directory

```

**import note**
   The items must be unique. duplicate items can result incorrect intersection result

**run job** 
```
nvflare simulator -w /tmp/nvflare/psi -n 3 -t 3 user_email_match/jobs/user_email_match
```
Once job completed and succeed, you should be able to find the intersection for different sites at

```
/tmp/nvflare/psi/simulate_job/site-1/psi/intersection.txt 
/tmp/nvflare/psi/simulate_job/site-2/psi/intersection.txt 
/tmp/nvflare/psi/simulate_job/site-3/psi/intersection.txt  
```
to compare these intersections, you can check with the followings:

```bash
diff <(sort /tmp/nvflare/psi/simulate_job/site-1/psi/intersection.txt) <(sort /tmp/nvflare/psi/simulate_job/site-2/psi/intersection.txt)
diff <(sort /tmp/nvflare/psi/simulate_job/site-2/psi/intersection.txt) <(sort /tmp/nvflare/psi/simulate_job/site-3/psi/intersection.txt)
```
