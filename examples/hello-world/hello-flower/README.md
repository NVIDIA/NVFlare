# Hello Flower (PyTorch)

This example demonstrates how to use NVIDIA FLARE with Flower to train an image classifier using federated averaging (FedAvg). The complete example code can be found in the `hello-flower directory <examples/hello-world/hello-flower/>`. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and run everything within a virtualenv.

## NVIDIA FLARE Installation

For the complete installation instructions, see [Installation](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/installation.html)
```
pip install nvflare
```

Install the dependency
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Structure

First get the example code from github:
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare.git
```
then navigate to the hello-flower directory:
```
git switch <release branch>
cd examples/hello-world/hello-flower
```

``` bash
hello-flower

|   |-- flwr_pt/
|   |   |-- client.py   # <-- contains `ClientApp`
|   |   |-- __init__.py # <-- to register the python module
|   |   |-- server.py   # <-- contains `ServerApp`
|   |   |-- task.py     # <-- task-specific code (model, data)

|   |-- flwr_pt_tb/
|   |   |-- client.py   # <-- contains `ClientApp` with TensorBoard
|   |   |-- __init__.py # <-- to register the python module
|   |   |-- server.py   # <-- contains `ServerApp`
|   |   |-- task.py     # <-- task-specific code (model, data)
|   |-- pyproject.toml  # <-- Flower project file
|-- job.py             # job recipe that defines client and server configurations
|-- requirements.txt   # dependencies
```

## Data

This example uses the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset

In a real FL experiment, each client would have their own dataset used for their local training. 
You can download the CIFAR10 dataset from the Internet via torchvision's datasets module, 
You can split the datasets for different clients, so that each client has its own dataset. 
Here for simplicity's sake, the same dataset we will be using on each client.

## Model

In PyTorch, neural networks are implemented by defining a class that extends nn.Module. 
The network's architecture is set up in the __init__ method, while the forward method determines how input data flows through the layers. For faster computations, the model is transferred to a hardware accelerator (such as CUDA GPUs) if available; otherwise, it runs on the CPU. The implementation of this model can be found in the `task.py` files within the Flower app directories and is based on a simple CNN adapted from 'PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz'.

## Client Code

The client code in `client.py` is responsible for local training and contains the **Flower Client App**.

## Server Code

In this example, we use Flower's built-in federated averaging **Strategy**. 
The server code is defined in `server.py` within each Flower app directory.
There is no need to define a customized server code for this example as Flower provides the FedAvg implementation.

## Job Recipe Code

Job Recipe contains the Flower app configuration and deployes it within NVFlare.
```
    recipe = FlowerRecipe(
        name="hello-flower",
        min_clients=n_clients,
        num_rounds=num_rounds,
        content_dir=content_dir,
        stream_metrics=stream_metrics,
    )

    env = SimEnv(num_clients=n_clients, num_threads=n_clients)
    recipe.execute(env=env)
```

## Run Job

From terminal try to run the code

### Run flwr-pt with NVFlare simulation
We run 2 Flower clients and Flower Server in parallel using NVFlare's simulator.
```
python job.py --job_name "flwr-pt" --content_dir "./flwr-pt"
```

### Run flwr-pt with NVFlare simulation and NVFlare's TensorBoard streaming
We run 2 Flower clients and Flower Server in parallel using NVFlare while streaming 
the TensorBoard metrics to the server at each iteration using NVFlare's metric streaming.
```
python job.py --job_name "flwr-pt-tb" --content_dir "./flwr-pt-tb" --stream_metrics
```

You can visualize the metrics streamed to the server using TensorBoard.
```
tensorboard --logdir /tmp/nvflare/hello-flower
```

### Run with real deployment

First, check real-world deployment guide: https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/user_guide/admin_guide/deployment/overview.html. 

You can run the job in a production environment by changing from `SimEnv` to `ProdEnv` in the `job.py` script.
