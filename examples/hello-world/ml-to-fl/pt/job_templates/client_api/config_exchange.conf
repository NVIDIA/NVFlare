  # exchange_path: when using FilePipe, where to exchange the parameters
  # When specifying using "relative" path, it will be relative to the
  # running job folder (xxx/JOB_ID) folder
  # The benefit is this folder will be managed by the NVFlare system
  # The drawback is that if 3rd party scripts has no way to know this
  # exchange path before NVFlare starts
  # In that case, you can specify this as an "absolute" path,
  # the advantage about absolute path is that you can start other systems before
  # NVFlare starts, note that you will also need to change "data_exchange_path"
  # of "FilePipeLauncherExecutor"/"PTFilePipeLauncherExecutor" in "config_fed_client.conf"
