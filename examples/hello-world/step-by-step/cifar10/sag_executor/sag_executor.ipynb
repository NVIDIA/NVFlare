    "# FedAvg using Executor\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate the FedAvg algorithm using the CIFAR10 dataset using an Executor. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the previous example [FedAvg with SAG workflow](../sag/sag.ipynb#title) utilized the Client API, here we will demonstrate how to convert the original training code into a Executor trainer, showcase its capabilities, and recommend the best use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We build on top of the previous example [FedAvg algorithm](../sag/sag.ipynb#title)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow these steps before proceeding to the next section:\n",

    "## Executor\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Executor` in FLARE is an FLComponent for clients used for executing tasks, wherein the `execute` method receives and returns a `Shareable` object given a task name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "- Executor is a client-side FLComponent for executing tasks\n",
    "- Produces `Shareable` from input `Shareable` and handles `DXO` object conversion for standardized data passing\n",
    "- Directly uses FLARE-specific communication concepts, and as such serves as the basis of higher level learning APIs made to abstract these concepts away\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [documentation](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/executor.html#executor) for more information about Executors and other FLARE-specific constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Executors\n",
    "\n",
    "The Executor is best used when implementing tasks and logic that do not fit the standard learning methods of higher-level APIs, such as the ModelLearner or Client API. In this example, in addition to the `train`, `validate`, and `submit_model` tasks, we also introduce the `get_weights` task. This pretrain task allows us to perform the `InitializeGlobalWeights` workflow, which would otherwise not be supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting DL training code to FL Executor training code\n",
    "We will use the original [Training a Classifer](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) example\n",
    "in PyTorch as our base [DL code](../code/dl/train.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to transform the existing PyTorch classifier training code into Federated Classifier training code, we must restructure our code to implement tasks to execute, as well as handle the data exchange formats. The converted code can be found at [FL Executor code](../code/fl/executor.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key changes:\n",
    "- Encapsulate the original DL train and validate code inside `local_train()` and `local_validate()` and the dataset and PyTorch training utilities in `initialize()`\n",
    "- Implement `execute` function to handle `get_weights`, `train`, `validate`, and `submit_model` tasks\n",
    "- Process incoming and outgoing `Shareable` objects, and converting to and from `DXO` objects\n",
    "- Implement `_save_local_model()` and `_load_local_model()` using the `PTPersistenceManager` to handle `ModelLearnable` object and manage the format for PyTorch model persistence.\n",
