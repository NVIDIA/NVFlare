    "# Cyclic Weight Transfer (CWT) with Client-Controlled Cyclic Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate the Client-Controlled Cyclic Workflow using the Client API with the CIFAR10 dataset. \n",
    "This differs from the [Server-Controlled Cyclic Workflow](../cyclic/cyclic.ipynb), as the server is not involved in communication with sensitive information in the case that is it not trusted.\n",

    "<img src=\"figs/cyclic_ccwf.png\" alt=\"cyclic ccwf\" width=35% height=35% />\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CyclicServerController` is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the job, and will assign `cyclic_config` and `cyclic_start` tasks for configuration and to begin the training workflow. The configuration includes picking the starting client, result clients, and defining the cyclic order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CyclicClientController` is responsible for the training logic once `cyclic_start` is sent, and the [Cyclic Workflow](../cyclic/cyclic.ipynb#cyclic_workflow) is algorithmically the same as the server-controlled version. The main difference is transferring the model is now encrypted with secure peer-to-peer messaging, and only the result clients receive the model, rather than the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [docs](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/controllers/client_controlled_workflows.html#cyclic-learning) for more information about the Client-Controlled Cyclic Workflow.\n",

    "## Converting DL training code to FL training code\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the [Client API FL code](../code/fl/train.py) trainer, which is converted from the original [Training a Classifier](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) example.\n",
