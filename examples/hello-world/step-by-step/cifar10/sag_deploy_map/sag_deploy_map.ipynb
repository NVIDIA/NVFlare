    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate the Feg Avg. SAG workflow using CIFAR10 dataset with site-specific configurations and deploy_map. \n",
    "\n",
    "We build on top of the previous example [FedAvg with SAG workflow](../sag/sag.ipynb#title)\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from the previous examples, we like to demonstrate how to deploy different \"app\" to different sites using different configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next section is going to be the same as previous example, please follow the steps \n",
    "  * [Understanding Fed Average and SAG](../sag/sag.ipynb#sag)\n",

    "## Job Folder and Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the details of the job configurations, let's first introduce few terminologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Job and App\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, when we referring NVFLARE job, we are referring the job folder which consists \n",
    "\n",
    "  * The job folder structure\n",
    "  * The job configuration and \n",
    "  * The custom codes \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the complete picture of the job is the followings:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The job has special folder structure\n",
    "  * The job is consists of many \"apps\" or \"applications\"\n",
    "  * each application is consists app's custom code and configurations. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  you probably has noticed the folder structure as \n",
    "```\n",
    "  <job folder>\n",
    "  | -- app\n",
    "  | -----config/\n",
    "  | --------config_fed_client.conf\n",
    "  | --------config_fed_server.conf\n",
    "  | -----custom\n",
    "  | --------train.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "  In such case, we only defined one app. We could define many apps. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  <job folder>\n",
    "  | -- app_server\n",
    "  | -- app_1\n",
    "  | -- app_2\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "  in above,we defined three apps, each can be used at different sites. We will discuss how to map the app to different site using deploy_map\n",

    "   \n",
    "### deploy_map\n",
    "\n",
    "What's \"deploy_map\" ? It is the \"application to site deployment mapping\". The deploy_map defines where to deploy these apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "For examaple, in meta.conf (or meta.json), you probably seen something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "    \"name\": \"my_job\",\n",
    "    \"resource_spec\": {},\n",

    "        \"app\": [\n",
    "            \"@ALL\"\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "specify that the application \"app\" will be deployed to ALL sites. \"@ALL\" is special symbol, short-hand for all participanting clients and server. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another example of deploy_map\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three \"app\"s: \"app_server\", \"app_1\", and \"app_2\". The deploy_map rules states, that \"app_server\" is only deploy to \"server\" site, \"app_1\" and \"app_2\" will be deployed to site-1 and site-2 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"name\": \"cifar10_splitnn\",\n",
    "    \"deploy_map\": {\n",
    "        \"app_server\": [\"server\"],\n",
    "        \"app_1\": [\"site-1\"],\n",
    "        \"app_2\": [\"site-2\"] \n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"min_clients\": 2,\n",

    "Like in previous example, we are going to use an exisiting job template to create our job folder via Job CLI. You can refer the [Job CLI tutorials](../../../../tutorials/job_cli.ipynb).\n",
    "  \n",
    "The **Advanced Section** discussed the site-specific configuration as well. The tutorial is similar to this example. \n",
