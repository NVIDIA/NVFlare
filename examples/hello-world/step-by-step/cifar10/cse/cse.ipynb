    "# Cross-Site Evaluation (with SAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate the Cross-Site Evaluation workflow using the Client API and the CIFAR10 dataset. In order to first produce models to perform cross-evaluation with, we run the [SAG workflow](../sag/sag.ipynb) beforehand.\n",

    "<img src=\"figs/cse.png\" alt=\"cse\" width=35% height=35% />\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: the diagram above illustrates evaluation on client-1's model, however in the workflow all participating clients will have their models evaluated by all other participating clients)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CrossSiteModelEval` workflow uses the data from clients to run evaluation with the models of other clients. Data is not shared, rather the collection of models is distributed by the server to each client site to run local validation. The server’s global model is also distributed to each client for evaluation on the client’s local dataset for global model evaluation. Finally, validation results are collected by the server to construct an all-to-all matrix of model performance vs. client dataset, and the `ValidationJsonGenerator` is used to write the results to a JSON file on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required tasks: \n",
    "- `validate` to perform validation on model using local dataset\n",
    "- `submit_model` to obtain the client model for validation\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using the [Client API FL code](../code/fl/train.py) trainer converted from the original [Training a Classifer](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key changes when writing a FL code to support multiple tasks:\n",
    "- When using the default `launch_once` parameter of `SubprocessLauncher`, we encapsulate our code in `while flare.is_running():` loop so we can call `flare.receive()` and perform various tasks. This is useful when launching everytime would be inefficient, such as when having to perform data setup every time.\n",
    "- We use `flare.is_train()`, `flare.is_evaluate()`, and `flare.is_submit_model()` for implementing the `train`, `validate`, and `submit_model` tasks depending on the mode.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Job Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must configure our client api trainer along with the Server-Controlled Cross-site Evaluation workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client configuration for the trainer with the Client API is standard with the PTClientAPILauncherExecutor, SubprocessLauncher, and our defined app script that supports the `train`, `validate`, and `submit_model` tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the server configuration, after `ScatterAndGather` we add the `CrossSiteModelEval` workflow, which uses the `validate` and `submit_model` tasks and requires a model locator. Under components the `PTFileModelLocator` is used to locate the models inventory saved during training, and an optional `IntimeModelSelector` is used to select the best global model to save based on the validation scores from the clients. Finally, the `ValidationJsonGenerator` generates `cross_val_results.json` which contains the accuracy of each validate model.\n",
