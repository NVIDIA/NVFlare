    "Swarm Learning is a decentralized Federated Averaging algorithm where the key difference is that the server is not trusted with any sensitive information. The server is now only responsible for job health and lifecycle management via the `SwarmServerController`, while the clients are now responsible for training and aggregation logic via the swarm client-controlled `SwarmClientController`.\n",

    "- `SwarmServerController`: manages swarm job lifecycle and configurations such as `aggr_clients` and `train_clients`\n",
    "- `SwarmClientController`: sends `learn_task`  to all training clients to invoke their executors for `train` task each round, and sends results to designated `aggr_client` for aggregation.\n",
