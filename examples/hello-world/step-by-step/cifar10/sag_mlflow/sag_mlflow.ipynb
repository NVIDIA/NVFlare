    "# FedAvg with MLflow tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate the FedAvg using the CIFAR10 dataset with MLflow tracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will show how to add tracking capabilities to the previous example [FedAvg with SAG workflow](../sag/sag.ipynb#title), specifically we will show how to add MLflow in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview on Federated Averaging and SAG, see the section from the previous example: [Understanding FedAvg and SAG](../sag/sag.ipynb#sag)\n",

    "## Experiment tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "In any machine learning and deep learning scenario, we are trying to get the best model after training.\n",
    "An important part of that is the convergence and keep tracks of different metrics / losses as training proceeds.\n",
    "There are many tracking tools available, for example TensorBoard, MLflow, and Weights and Biases.\n",
    "NVFlare has the capability to incorporate these tools to send all the client site's metrics and losses back to the server site.\n",
    "And you can monitor and keep tracking of the whole federated learning progress by interacting with the NVFlare server machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training code changes\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to just import the MLflowWriter, create an instance of it and you can use the methods it provides.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "import nvflare.client as flare\n",
    "from nvflare.client.tracking import MLflowWriter\n",
    "\n",
    "flare.init()\n",
    "mlflow = MLflowWriter()\n",
