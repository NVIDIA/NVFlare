    "# Cyclic Weight Transfer (CWT) with Cyclic Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate the Cyclic workflow using the Client API with the CIFAR10 dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cyclic Workflow\n",
    "<a id = \"cyclic_workflow\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclic Weight Transfer (CWT) uses the server-controlled `CyclicController` to pass the model weights from one site to the next in a cyclic fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Cyclic workflow, sites train one at a time, while sending the model to the next site. The order of the sites can be specified as fixed, random, or random (without same in a row).  A round is finished once all sites in the defined order have completed training once, and the final result is returned to the server. This differs from Scatter-and-Gather, wherein all sites train simultaneously and aggregate their results together at the end of a round.\n",

    "For the server configuration we use the `CyclicController` for the workflow, and define arguments such as number of rounds, order of relaying sites, and the `train` task name that the clients support.
