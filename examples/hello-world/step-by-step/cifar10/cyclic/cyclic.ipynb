    "# Cyclic Weight Transfer (CWT) with Cyclic Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate the Cyclic workflow using the Client API with the CIFAR10 dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cyclic Workflow\n",
    "<a id = \"cyclic_workflow\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclic Weight Transfer (CWF) uses the server-controlled `CyclicController` to pass the model weights from one site to the next in a cyclic fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Cyclic workflow, sites train one at a time, while sending the model to the next site. The order of the sites can be specifed as fixed, random, or random (without same in a row).  A round is finished once all sites in the defined order have completed training once, and the final result is returned to the server. This differs from Scatter-and-Gather, wherein all sites train simultaneously and aggregrate their results together at the end of a round.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting DL training code to FL training code\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the [Client API FL code](../code/fl/train.py) trainer converted from the original [Training a Classifer](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) example.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Converting to FL code using Client API](../sag/sag.ipynb#code) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Job Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The client configuration for the trainer with the Client API is standard with the `PTClientAPILauncherExecutor`, `SubprocessLauncher`, and our defined `train.py` that supports the `train` task. This is the same configuration used in the SAG pt workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the server configuration we use the `CyclicController` for the workflow, and define arguments such as number of rounds, order of relaying sites, and the `train` task name that the clients support. The two required components ids are also mapped to the corresponding `PTFileModelPersistor` and `FullModelShareableGenerator` defined under components.\n",
