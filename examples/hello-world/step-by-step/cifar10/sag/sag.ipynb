    "# FedAvg algorithm\n",
    "<a id = \"title\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate the FedAvg algorithm using the CIFAR10 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Job life-cycle and training workflow are controlled on the server side; we will just use the existing available SAG controller available in NVFLARE.\n",
    "\n",
    "For client-side training code, we will leverage the new DL to FL Client API.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's look at the FedAvg Algorithm and SAG Workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scatter and Gather (SAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "NVFLARE's Scatter and Gather workflow is similar to the Message Passing Interface (MPI)'s MPI Broadcast and MPI Gather. [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) is a standardized and portable message-passing standard designed to function on parallel computing architectures. MPI consists of some [collective communication routines](https://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/mpi-broadcast-and-collective-communication/), such as MPI Broadcast, MPI Scatter, and MPI Gather.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## FedAvg with SAG\n",
    "We use [SAG workflow](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/controllers/scatter_and_gather_workflow.html) to implement the FedAvg algorithm. You can see one round of training in such workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fed_avg_one_round.png\" alt=\"FedAvg\" width=35% height=30% />\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"fed_avg.png\" alt=\"FedAvg\" width=50% height=45% /> <img src=\"sag.png\" alt=\"Scatter and Gather\" width=40% height=40% />\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregation of FedAvg is done on the server side; it is weighted by the number of training steps on each client.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Convert training code to federated learning training code\n",
    "<a id = \"code\"></a>\n",
    "We will use the original [Training a Classifer](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) example\n",
    "from pytorch as the code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original code with some clean-up (remove comments etc.) can be found in [here](../code/dl/train.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the NVFLARE DL to FL Client APIs, we need to transform the existing pytorch classifer training code into Federated Classifer training code with few lines of code changes. The already converted code can be found in **[here](../code/fl/train.py)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed discussion how to convert training code into federated learning training code using Client API, you can also checked out the examples [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/examples/hello-world/ml-to-fl/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key changes are the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    #  import nvflare client API\n",
    "    import nvflare.client as flare\n",
    "\n",
    "    #  initializes NVFlare client API\n",
    "    flare.init()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # gets FLModel from NVFlare\n",
    "    input_model = flare.receive()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # loads model from NVFlare\n",
    "    net.load_state_dict(input_model.params)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # evaluate on received model\n",
    "    accuracy = evaluate(input_model.params)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # construct trained FL model\n",
    "    output_model = flare.FLModel(\n",
    "        params=net.cpu().state_dict(),\n",
    "        metrics={\"accuracy\": accuracy},\n",
    "        meta={\"NUM_STEPS_CURRENT_ROUND\": steps},\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # send model back to NVFlare\n",
    "    flare.send(output_model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using pytorch-lightning, the changes are much smaller, 1-line import , 1-line change applies to trainer, 1-line global model evaluation. see [cifar10_lightning_examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/examples/hello-world/ml-to-fl/pt/cifar10_lightning_fl.py) \n",
