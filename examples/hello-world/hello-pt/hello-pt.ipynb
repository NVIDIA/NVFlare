    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "At the heart of NVFlare lies the concept of collaboration through\n",
    "\"tasks.\" An FL controller assigns tasks (e.g., training on local data) to one or more FL clients, processes returned\n",
    "results (e.g., model weight updates), and may assign additional\n",
    "tasks based on these results and other factors (e.g., a pre-configured\n",
    "number of training rounds). The clients run executors which can listen for tasks and perform the necessary computations locally, such as model training. This task-based interaction repeats\n",
    "until the experiment’s objectives are met. \n",
