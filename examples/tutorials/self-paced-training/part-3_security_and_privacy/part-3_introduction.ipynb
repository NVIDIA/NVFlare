    "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. However, FL introduces security and privacy risks, such as data leakage, adversarial attacks, and model integrity threats.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concerns  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy Risks**: Model updates can leak information through gradient leakage, membership inference, and property inference attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy Protections**: Techniques like differential privacy, secure aggregation, and homomorphic encryption mitigate exposure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Challenges**: FL is vulnerable to adversarial model poisoning, unauthorized access, and communication threats.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Solutions**: Authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), encrypted communication (TLS), and trust-based mechanisms enhance FL security.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA FLARE addresses these concerns with secure aggregation, cryptographic protections, and robust access controls, ensuring FL remains both effective and trustworthy.\n",
