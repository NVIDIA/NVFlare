    "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. This paradigm is particularly vital for sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and smart cities, where data privacy is paramount. However, the distributed nature of FL introduces unique security and privacy challenges, such as safeguarding against data leakage, adversarial attacks, and ensuring the integrity of model updates. NVIDIA FLARE addresses these concerns by providing a robust, extensible framework designed for secure and privacy-preserving FL workflows. By incorporating advanced cryptographic techniques, secure aggregation protocols, and role-based access control, NVIDIA FLARE empowers organizations to harness the full potential of FL while mitigating risks associated with data and model vulnerabilities. This ensures that collaborative machine learning remains not only effective but also trustworthy.\n"

    "Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables multiple participants to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. This approach enhances privacy and efficiency but also introduces security and privacy challenges unique to distributed learning environments. Ensuring robust FL deployments requires addressing both **privacy protection** and **security mechanisms**, as well as mitigating potential attacks.  \n",

    "1. **Security and privacy protection in FL** (general overview).  \n",
    "2. **Privacy attacks and protection approaches** (threats and defenses).  \n",

    "### **1.1 Privacy in FL**  \n",
    "- **Privacy-Preserving Nature**: Unlike centralized learning, FL ensures that sensitive user data remains local, reducing exposure risks.  \n",
    "- **Threats to Privacy**: Even though raw data isn't shared, model updates (gradients, weights) can still reveal private information through reconstruction attacks.  \n",
    "- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Differential privacy, secure aggregation, and homomorphic encryption are commonly employed to mitigate risks.  \n",
