    "### Differential Privacy (DP)\n",
    "[Differential Privacy (DP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00962) [1] is a rigorous mathematical framework designed to provide strong privacy guarantees when handling sensitive data. In the context of Federated Learning (FL), DP plays a crucial role in safeguarding user information by introducing randomness into the training process. Specifically, it ensures privacy by adding carefully calibrated noise to the model updates—such as gradients or weights—before they are transmitted from clients to the central server. This obfuscation mechanism makes it statistically difficult to infer whether any individual data point contributed to a particular update, thereby protecting user-specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating DP into FL, even if an adversary gains access to the aggregated updates or models, the added noise prevents them from accurately deducing sensitive details about any individual client's data. Common approaches include \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Differential Privacy (LDP)**, where noise is added directly on the client side before updates are sent\n",
    "2. **Global Differential Privacy (GDP)**, where noise is injected after aggregation at the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance between privacy and model utility is typically managed through a privacy budget (ϵ), which quantifies the trade-off between the level of noise added and the resulting model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first example, we show you how to add **local** DP filters to your FL training in NVFlare. Here, we use the \"Sparse Vector Technique\", i.e. the [SVTPrivacy](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.app_common.filters.svt_privacy.html) protocol, as utilized in [Li et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00962) [1] (see [Lyu et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01699) [2] for more information). \n",
    "\n",
    "DP is added as an NVFlare `Filter` using the [FedJob API](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/fed_job_api.html#fedjob-api) you should have seen in prior chapters."

    "The [Sparse Vector Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01699) (SVT) enhances privacy by applying noise and thresholding to a randomly selected subset of model weights or updates, $x$. The process consists of two main steps:\n",

    "\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "This notebook explores two methods for adding Differential Privacy (DP) noise to model training: using an NVFlare `Filter` or integrating Opacus within your local training script. These approaches enhance privacy by reducing the risk of memorizing individual data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "DP remains an active research area, and the optimal choice of parameters depends on your specific problem and risk tolerance. A smaller epsilon provides stronger privacy but introduces more noise, potentially lowering accuracy. This trade-off should be carefully navigated. A recommended technique from [Opacus](https://opacus.ai/tutorials/building_image_classifier#Tips-and-Tricks) is to pre-train on public data before fine-tuning on private data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further research into quantifying model memorization and data leakage during training can provide deeper insights into privacy risks. For more details, refer to our paper on [gradient inversion](../../../../../../research/quantifying-data-leakage/README.md) [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06924) which is also implemented in NVFlare.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training large language models with DP, refer to the latest Opacus examples, which can be seamlessly integrated into NVFlare deployments.
