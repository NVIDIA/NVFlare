    "This example includes instructions on running [FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) with [homomorphic encryption](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/federated-learning-with-homomorphic-encryption/) (originally developed for Clara Train's FL feature, the predecessor of NVFlare).\n",

    "It uses the provisioning and the admin API to submit jobs, similar to how one would set up experiments in real-world deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "HE encryption and decryption are added as filters using the [FedJob API](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/fed_job_api.html#fedjob-api) you should have seen in prior chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The communication channels in NVFlare are TLS-encrypted using the certificates provided by the provisioning tool. However, each client can receive additional keys to homomorphically encrypt their model updates before sending them to the server. The server doesn’t own a key and only sees the encrypted model updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "HE allows the server to aggregate these encrypted weights and then send the updated model back to the client. The clients can decrypt the model weights because they have the keys and can continue with the next round of training.\n",

    "Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data, which is especially useful for preserving privacy in a federated learning setting.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the client side, to configure homomorphic encryption we must add the following HE filters in config_fed_client.conf:\n",
