    Wrapper around MONAI's UNet implementation.

    Args:
        spatial_dims: number of spatial dimensions.
        in_channels: number of input channels.
        out_channels: number of output channels.
        channels: sequence of channels. Top block first. The length of `channels` should be no less than 2.
        strides: sequence of convolution strides. The length of `stride` should equal to `len(channels) - 1`.
        kernel_size: convolution kernel size, the value(s) should be odd. If sequence,
            its length should equal to dimensions. Defaults to 3.
        up_kernel_size: upsampling convolution kernel size, the value(s) should be odd. If sequence,
            its length should equal to dimensions. Defaults to 3.
        num_res_units: number of residual units. Defaults to 0.
        act: activation type and arguments. Defaults to PReLU.
        norm: feature normalization type and arguments. Defaults to instance norm.
        dropout: dropout ratio. Defaults to no dropout.
        bias: whether to have a bias term in convolution blocks. Defaults to True.
        adn_ordering: a string representing the ordering of activation (A), normalization (N), and dropout (D).
            Defaults to "NDA".
