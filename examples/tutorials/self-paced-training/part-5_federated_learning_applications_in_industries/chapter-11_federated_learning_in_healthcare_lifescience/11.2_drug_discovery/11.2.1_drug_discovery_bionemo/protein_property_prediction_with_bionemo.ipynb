    "Here, we are interested in training a neural network to predict subcellular location from an embedding.\n",

    "The data we will be using comes from the paper [\"Light attention predicts protein location from the language of life\"](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformaticsadvances/article/1/1/vbab035/6432029) by Stärk et al. In this paper, the authors developed a machine learning algorithm to predict the subcellular location of proteins from sequence through protein language models that are similar to those available in BioNeMo. Protein subcellular location refers to where the protein localizes in the cell; for example, a protein may be expressed in the Nucleus or in the Cytoplasm. Knowing where proteins localize can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of cellular processes and help identify potential targets for drug development. The following image includes a few examples of subcellular locations in an animal cell:\n",
