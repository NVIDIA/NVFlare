    "# Privacy-Preserving AI in Drug Discovery: Federated Learning Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Drug discovery is a complex and data-intensive process that often involves sensitive biological and chemical data across multiple institutions. Traditional approaches to AI in drug discovery require sharing raw data between organizations, which raises significant privacy and intellectual property concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training while keeping the data private and secure at its source.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explores two practical applications of federated learning in drug discovery, focusing on protein modeling and property prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Protein Property Prediction with BioNeMo](../11.2.1_drug_discovery_bionemo/protein_property_prediction_with_bionemo.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first application demonstrates how to use NVIDIA's BioNeMo framework for federated protein property prediction. This example specifically focuses on subcellular location prediction, a crucial task in understanding protein function and potential drug targets. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tuning of ESM-2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) models in a federated setting\n",
    "- Implementation of heterogeneous data distribution across clients\n",
    "- Practical demonstration of privacy-preserving protein sequence analysis\n",
    "- Integration with NVIDIA's BioNeMo Framework for efficient protein language model training\n",
    "\n",
    "[Multi-task Drug Discovery with AMPLIFY](../11.2.2_drug_discovery_amplify/finetuning_amplify.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second application showcases another approach to drug discovery using the AMPLIFY model -- a specialized variant of the ESM-2 protein language model that features a redesigned layer architecture and a purpose-built training dataset. This example demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tuning of an AMPLIFY model for molecular property prediction in a federated setting\n",
    "- Multi-task learning capabilities for various drug discovery tasks\n",
    "- Multiple regression tasks for handling diverse drug discovery challenges\n",
    "- Practical implementation of federated learning for biopharmaceutical research\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Federated Learning in Drug Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples highlight several key advantages of using federated learning in drug discovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Privacy Preservation**: Sensitive biological and chemical data remains within each institution\n",
    "2. **Collaborative Learning**: Multiple organizations can contribute to model development without sharing raw data\n",
    "3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps meet data protection requirements while enabling research collaboration\n",
    "4. **Intellectual Property Protection**: Maintains control over proprietary data while benefiting from collective knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Both examples require specific computational resources and software environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NVIDIA GPUs (tested on A100 with 80GB memory)\n",
    "- Docker environment for BioNeMo\n",
    "- Python 3.10+ environment\n",
    "- NVFlare framework (version 2.6 or higher)\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples are designed to be run in a simulated federated environment, making them suitable for both learning and practical implementation in real-world drug discovery scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the BioNeMo example in the next [section](../11.2.1_drug_discovery_bionemo/protein_property_prediction_with_bionemo.ipynb)."
