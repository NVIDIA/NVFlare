    "# Federated Fine-tuning of an AMPLIFY Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use the AMPLIFY protein language model from [chandar-lab/AMPLIFY](https://github.com/chandar-lab/AMPLIFY) for fine-tuning on multiple downstream tasks. AMPLIFY is a powerful protein language model that can be adapted for various protein-related tasks. In this example, we'll show how to fine-tune AMPLIFY for the prediction of several protein properties using antibody sequence data. For more details, please refer this [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.614603v1).\n",

See the [run_fl_multitask.py](run_fl_multitask.py) where we add the [ExcludeParamsFilter](src/filters.py) filter."

For full training, we recommend using at least three A100 GPUs and distribute the six clients among them using the `--sim_gpus` option as shown in the comment using a batch size of 64 by changing the default value in `finetune_seqclassification_fl.py`.</div>"
