    "This example demonstrates how to use the AMPLIFY protein language model from [chandar-lab/AMPLIFY](https://github.com/chandar-lab/AMPLIFY) for fine-tuning on multiple downstream tasks. AMPLIFY is a powerful protein language model that can be adapted for various protein-related tasks. In this example, we'll show how to fine-tune AMPLIFY for the prediction of several protein properties using antibody sequence data. For more details, please refer this [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.614603v1).\n",

    "    - Local training: Each data owner/client trains only on their local data.\n",
