    "Let's first clone Holohub and build the endoscopy out-of-body detection application. Out-of-body detection is an important application in robot-assisted endoscopic surgeries. It helps identify which frames from the endoscope camera are out of the patient body, which might capture personal information about the operating room staff. Storing or broadcasting endoscope camera data without any deidentification might introduce a breach of data privacy regulations. With automatic detection of out-of-body endoscopic frames, a subsequent anonymization of these frames (using, for instance, Gaussian blur or mosaic pixelation) can be applied, achieving automatic deidentification of endoscope camera data. \n",

    "## Compute Hierarchical Federated Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The [official repository for Holoscan Federated Analytics](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holoscan-federated-analytics) provides a sample FLARE application `holoscan_fl_example` that computes several federated statistical values from different clients. We will run this sample FLARE application in this tutorial, which is copied under `code/application/holoscan_fl_example`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's understand what this application is computing. From the [server's configuration](code/application/holoscan_fl_example/app/config/config_fed_server.json), we can see that this application is using the [HierarchicalStatisticsController](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/nvflare/app_common/workflows/hierarchical_statistics_controller.py), to aggregate the following statistical values from the clients:\n",
    "- `count`\n",
    "- `sum`\n",
    "- `max`\n",
    "- `min`\n",
    "- `mean`\n",
    "- `var` \n",
    "- `stddev`\n",
    "- `histogram`\n",
    "\n",
    "Local statistics computation is implemented in [code/application/holoscan_fl_example/app/custom/holoscan_statistics.py](code/application/holoscan_fl_example/app/custom/holoscan_statistics.py), which will be used by FLARE's [StatisticsExecutor](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/nvflare/app_common/executors/statistics/statistics_executor.py), as defined in [code/application/holoscan_fl_example/app/config/config_fed_client.json](code/application/holoscan_fl_example/app/config/config_fed_client.json).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [HierarchicalStatisticsController](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/nvflare/app_common/workflows/hierarchical_statistics_controller.py) is **hierarchical** because it exposes a `hierarchy_config` argument to specify the **hierarchy configuration** among all clients. Once a client hierarchy specified, the aggregated statistics will be computed for each hierarchical level. In this sample app, the hierarchy configuration is located at [code/application/holoscan_fl_example/app/config/device_map_2.json](code/application/holoscan_fl_example/app/config/device_map_2.json), with the following content:\n",
    "```json\n",

    "  \"Manufacturers\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"Name\": \"Manufacturer-1\",\n",
    "      \"Devices\": [\"Holoscan-Device-1\"]\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"Name\": \"Manufacturer-2\",\n",
    "      \"Devices\": [\"Holoscan-Device-2\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration defines 3 hierarchical levels: device level, manufacturer level and global level. Therefore aggregated statistics will be computed at:\n",
    "- Each device individually (this is in fact the local statistics)\n",
    "- Each manufacturer's devices\n",
    "- Global level, for all devices from all manufacturers\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about hierarchical statistics, please refer to [this example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/advanced/federated-statistics/hierarchical_stats) in NVIDIA FLARE's tutorial catalog, which shows how to compute various statistics under a complex hierarchy.\n",
