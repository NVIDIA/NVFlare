    "Federated Learning (FL) is revolutionizing industries by enabling collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy and security. In healthcare and life sciences, FL facilitates the development of robust predictive models by aggregating insights from diverse, geographically dispersed medical datasets without sharing sensitive patient information. Applications include enhancing diagnostic accuracy, predicting disease progression, and enabling personalized treatment plans. FL is also critical in drug discovery, allowing collaboration across pharmaceutical organizations to accelerate research without compromising proprietary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In financial services, FL addresses challenges related to data confidentiality and compliance by enabling institutions to collaboratively train fraud detection, credit risk assessment, and anti-money laundering models. By combining insights from multiple banks or financial entities, FL improves the accuracy of predictive algorithms without exposing sensitive client data. This approach not only enhances model performance but also ensures adherence to stringent regulatory standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across these industries, FL bridges the gap between data utility and privacy, unlocking new possibilities for innovation while maintaining trust and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 5, we will use two chapters to show how to apply federated learning in different use cases. \n"
