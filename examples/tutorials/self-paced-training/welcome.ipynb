    "# Course Goals\n",
    "In this course, our primary goal is to **introduce the fundamentals of NVIDIA FLARE to researchers, scientists, and developers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This five-part, 12-chapter course is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and skills to develop and deploy federated learning applications using NVIDIA FLARE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1-3 (Chapter 1-6): Practial Federated Learning with NVIDIA FLARE - Fundamentals and System Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the comprehensive course introduces the essential concepts and practical implementation of federated learning using NVIDIA FLARE. Designed for researchers, data scientists, and developers new to federated learning, the course covers fundamental concepts, basic system architecture, and core implementation patterns. Through hands-on exercises, participants learn to develop and deploy basic federated learning applications, understand system components, and implement essential privacy and security measures.\n",
    "The curriculum focuses on building a strong foundation through practical examples, starting with simulator-based development and progressing to basic system deployment and security considerations. Upon completion, participants will understand the fundamentals of NVIDIA FLARE’s architecture, be able to implement basic federated learning workflows, and have a solid grounding in privacy-preserving distributed learning concepts. Basic Python programming skills and machine learning fundamentals are prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 4-5 (Chapter 7-12): Mastering Federated Learning with NVIDIA FLARE - Advanced Techniques and Industry Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this comprehensive course builds upon the foundations to explore cutting-edge techniques and real-world applications using NVIDIA FLARE. Designed for practitioners with basic federated learning knowledge, the course delves into advanced algorithms (FedOpt, FedProx), specialized workflows (cyclic learning, split learning), and complex implementations including federated LLM fine-tuning and secure XGBoost.\n",
    "Through industry-specific case studies in healthcare, financial services, and other sectors, participants learn to adapt and deploy federated learning solutions for real-world challenges. The course emphasizes practical implementation, advanced security measures, and production-ready system design. Upon completion, participants will be able to architect and implement sophisticated federated learning solutions for enterprise applications. Prior completion of Chapter 1-6 or equivalent experience with NVIDIA FLARE is recommended. NVIDIA GPU access is required for optimal learning experience.\n"

    "\n",
    "Prerequisites of this course include:\n",
    "- Python programming skills\n",
    "- Basic understanding of machine learning & deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This course contains multiple examples that we will walkthrough and run together. It is helpful to have experiences in machine learning / deep learning libraries such as `numpy`, `pytorch`, but these are not mandatory, as we will only us basic APIs of these SDKs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding hardware, most of the examples can be run on NVIDIA T4 or equivalent GPUs, or even in CPU-only environment. Having more powerful GPUs could help accelerate the compute for some of the examples in this course. In particular, Part 4 & 5 will require NVIDIA GPU, while part 1 to 3 would be ok with CPU but NVIDIA GPU will help to accelerate. \n"

    "# Course Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is broken down into the following 5 parts. While each notebook can run independently, and you can skip certain chapters or sections, it is recommended to follow them one-by-one in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 1: Introduction to Federated Learning](./part-1_federated_learning_introduction/part_1_introduction.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Running and developing federated learning applications using a simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 2: Federated Learning System](./part-2_federated_learning_system/part-2_introduction.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we dive into NVIDIA FLARE's federated learning/computing system, including system architecture, deployment process, deployment simulation, and interaction with the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 3: Security and Privacy](./part-3_security_and_privacy/part-3_introduction.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we understand the basics of federated learning applications and federated computing systems, we will dive into other aspects of federated learning applications: privacy and security. We will discuss privacy and security concerns, different Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs), as well as enterprise security support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 4: Advanced Topics in Federated Learning](./part-4_advanced_federated_learning/part-4_introduction.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss federated learning with advanced topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different federated learning algorithms such as FedOpt, FedProx, etc.\n",
    "* Different federated learning workflows: cyclic, split learning, swarm learning\n",
    "* How to train or fine-tune large language models\n",
    "* How to train secure federated XGBoost\n",
    "* FLARE high-level vs. low-level APIs: dive into low-level but powerful APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 5: Federated Learning in Different Industries](./part-5_federated_learning_applications_in_industries/part-5_introduction.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have covered quite a bit of federated learning techniques. How do we apply them to different training use cases for cancer studies or fraud detection? Part 5 will show you how to use these techniques in different applications."
