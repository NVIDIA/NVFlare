    "# Runing Federated Learning Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore the process of running federated learning applications. We will start by setting up the environment and preparing the data, followed by training a classifier using PyTorch. We will then convert deep learning models to federated learning, customize server and client logic, and setup track experiments. Finally, we will delve into the job structure and configurations, including running a simulator, and conclude with a recap of the covered topics.\n",
