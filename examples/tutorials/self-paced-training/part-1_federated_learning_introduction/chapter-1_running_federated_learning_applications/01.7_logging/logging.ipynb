    "# NVIDIA FLARE Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we finish chapter one, we would like to discuss logging. This will help us with debugging in the following chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed logging configuration can be found in the [documentation](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/2.6/user_guide/configurations/logging_configuration.html), as well as in the [logging tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/examples/tutorials/logging.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are few key features of the logging in NVIDIA FLARE:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured logging\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining new loggers, FLARE provides several functions to help adhere loggers to the Python package hierarchy. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we have a custom class `MyClass` defined in module: `my_package.my_module`. Then we can:\n",
    "- Use `get_obj_logger()` to create class-level logger. For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "        class MyClass:\n",
    "            def __init__(self):\n",
    "            self.logger = get_obj_logger(self) # my_package.my_module.MyClass\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Use `get_script_logger()` to create script-level logger. For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "            logger = get_script_logger() # my_package.my_module\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  If the script is not in a package, the hierarchy will default to `custom.<script_file_name>`         \n",
    "- Use `get_module_logger()` to create module-level logger. For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "        def my_function():\n",
    "            logger = get_module_logger(name=\"my_function\") # my_package.my_module.my_function\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use these functions to create your loggers, you will have a better hierarchy and the logging configuration can be configured in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can enable a module logging level, which can define all the sub-modules' logging levels if not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple logging formats\n",
    "\n",
    "FLARE supports and creates multiple logging formats, including JSON and txt formats. The JSON format is more useful for integrating with monitoring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `log.txt`: The `logFileHandler` uses the `baseFormatter` to write all logs to `log.txt`. This is the default log that we see in the console.\n",
    "- `log.json`: The `jsonFileHandler` uses the `jsonFormatter` to write `JSON` formatted logs to `log.json`. This is useful for leveraging structured logs (i.e., with a 3rd party observability package).\n",
    "- `log_error.txt`: The `errorFileHandler` uses the `baseFormatter` and level `ERROR` to write error level logs to `log_error.txt`. This allows users to easily see when errors are logged.\n",
    "- `log_fl.txt`: The `FLFileHandler` uses the `baseFormatter` and `FLFilter` (uses` LoggerNameFilter` allowing certain logger names) to write FL training and custom logs to `log_fl.txt`. This removes the system and communication related logs and clearly shows logs related to FL training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logging mode for simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a few special log configurations for simulation. This will reduce the amount of log information seen by data scientists, so they can focus on the training logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three logging modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **concise**: filters out server and client process logs, only contains the application logs\n",
    "* **full**: is the full log\n",
    "* **verbose**: is the debug level of full log\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator defaults to ```concise``` mode, which is the most useful for data scientists to see the training logs. This also true when running a job with simulator using the Job API. You can configure the logging behavior in Job API as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "job.simulator_run(job_config_dir, log_config=\"full\")\n",
    "job.simulator_run(job_config_dir, log_config=\"verbose\")\n",
    "job.simulator_run(job_config_dir, log_config=\"concise\")\n",
    "job.simulator_run(job_config_dir, log_config=\"/path/to/log_config.json)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Logging Configuration Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the FLARE system (POC mode or production mode), in many cases, we need to change the logging level or configuration dynamically without stopping the system. Dynamic logging configuration provides these capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two sets of logs: the site logs and job logs. The current site log configuration will be used for the site logs as well as the log configuration of any new job started on that site.  \n",
    " \n",
    "We provide two admin commands: `configure_site_log` and `configure_job_log` in [FLARE Console](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/2.6/real_world_fl/operation.html#operating-nvflare), to enable users to dynamically configure the site or job level logging when running the FLARE system. Note these command effects will last until reconfiguration or as long as the corresponding site or job is running. However these commands do not overwrite the log configuration file in the workspace.  The previous the log configuration file can be reloaded using “reload”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "configure_site_log server debug\n",
    "configure_site_log client site-1 debug\n",
    "configure_site_log all info\n",
    "\n",
    "configure_job_log <job_id> server debug\n",
    "configure_job_log <job_id> client site-1 debug\n",
    "configure_job_log <job_id> all info\n",
    "configure_job_log <job_id> all <path>/<to>/custom_log_config.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```configure_site_log``` is the FLARE Console command used to configure the site log configuration.  \n",
    "The ```configure_job_log``` is the FLARE Console command used to configure job log configuration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Customizing logging\n",
    "You can always customize logging by adding or removing filters, formats and profile your own logging configuration for simulation, job and system. We are not going to cover this in this tutorial."
