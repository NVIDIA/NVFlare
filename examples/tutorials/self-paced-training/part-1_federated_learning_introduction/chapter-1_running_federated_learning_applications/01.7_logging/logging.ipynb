    "# NVIDIA FLARE Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we finish chapter one, we would like to discuss logging. This will help us with debugging in the following chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed logging configuration can be found in the [NVFlare Documentation](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/user_guide/configurations/logging_configuration.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "as well as in the [NVFlare Logging Tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/examples/tutorials/logging.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are few key features of the logging in NVFlare:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining new loggers, we provide several functions to help adhere to the FLARE package logger hierarchy. For example, say we have the following module at my_package.my_module:\n",
    "\n",
    "get_obj_logger for classes. Ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "        class MyClass:\n",
    "            def __init__(self):\n",
    "            self.logger = get_obj_logger(self) # my_package.my_module.MyClass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "get_script_logger for scripts (if not in a package, default to custom.<script_file_name>). Ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "            logger = get_script_logger() # my_package.my_module\n",
    "```            \n",
    "get_module_logger for modules. Ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        def my_function():\n",
    "            logger = get_module_logger(name=\"my_function\") # my_package.my_module.my_function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use these functions to create your loggers, you will have a better hierarchy and the logging configuration can be configured in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can enable a module logging level, which can define all the sub-modules' logging levels if not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple logging formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "NVFlare supports and creates multiple logging formats, including JSON and txt formats. The JSON format is more useful for integrating with monitoring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "log.txt:\n",
    "The logFileHandler uses the baseFormatter to write all logs to log.txt. This is the default log that we see in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "log.json:\n",
    "The jsonFileHandler uses the jsonFormatter to write JSON formatted logs to log.json. This is useful for leveraging structured logs (i.e., with a 3rd party observability package).\n",
    "\n",
    "log_error.txt:\n",
    "The errorFileHandler uses the baseFormatter and level \"ERROR\" to write error level logs to log_error.txt. This allows users to easily see when errors are logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "log_fl.txt:\n",
    "The FLFileHandler uses the baseFormatter and FLFilter (uses LoggerNameFilter allowing certain logger names) to write FL training and custom logs to log_fl.txt. This removes the system and communication related logs and clearly shows logs related to FL training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logging mode for simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a few special log configurations for simulation. This will reduce the amount of log information seen by data scientists, so they can focus on the training logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three logging modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **concise**: filters out server and client process logs, only contains the application logs\n",
    "* **full**: is the full log\n",
    "* **verbose**: is the debug level of full log\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator defaults to ```concise``` mode, which is the most useful for data scientists to see the training logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Logging Configuration Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the FLARE system (POC mode or production mode), in many cases, we need to change the logging level or configuration dynamically without stopping the system. Dynamic logging configuration provides these capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two sets of logs: the site logs and job logs. The current site log configuration will be used for the site logs as well as the log configuration of any new job started on that site.  \n",
    " \n",
    "We provide two admin commands to enable users to dynamically configure the site or job level logging when running the FLARE system. Note these command effects will last until reconfiguration or as long as the corresponding site or job is running. However these commands do not overwrite the log configuration file in the workspace.  The previous the log configuration file can be reloaded using “reload”.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "here are more examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "configure_site_log server debug\n",
    "configure_site_log client site-1 debug\n",
    "configure_site_log all info\n",
    "\n",
    "configure_job_log <job_id> server debug\n",
    "configure_job_log <job_id> client site-1 debug\n",
    "configure_job_log <job_id> all info\n",
    "configure_job_log <job_id> all <path>/<to>/custom_log_config.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```configure_site_log``` is the FLARE Console command used to configure the site log configuration.  \n",
    "The ```configure_job_log``` is the FLARE Console command used to configure job log configuration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customizing logging\n",
    "You can always customize logging by adding or removing filters, formats and profile your own logging configuration for simulation, job and system. We are not going to cover this in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FLARE Job Simulator Run Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Flare Job API uses the simulator to run, it defaults to concise mode. If you want to use different log configure, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "job.simulator_run(job_config_dir, log_config=\"full\")\n",
    "job.simulator_run(job_config_dir, log_config=\"verbose\")\n",
    "job.simulator_run(job_config_dir, log_config=\"concise\")\n",
    "job.simulator_run(job_config_dir, log_config=\"/path/to/log_config.json)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have briefly introduced the logging configuration, let's wrap up this chapter: [wrap up](..//01.8_recap/recap.ipynb) \n",
