    "# Recap: Chapter 1 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, we've learned several crucial concepts and practical skills in federated learning. Here are the essential takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Federated Learning Fundamentals**\n",
    "   - FL enables collaborative model training while keeping data at source\n",
    "   - Basic FL workflow: client training → model aggregation → model broadcast → repeat\n",
    "   - NVIDIA FLARE provides a robust framework for implementing FL systems\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Converting Traditional to Federated Learning**\n",
    "   - Most PyTorch models can be adapted for federated learning\n",
    "   - Key modifications needed:\n",
    "     - Separating training logic from model loading. The model can be received and sent back to the server, while keeping the training logic mostly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customization Capabilities**\n",
    "   - Server-side customization:\n",
    "     - Implementing custom aggregation strategies\n",
    "     - Model selection and persistence\n",
    "     - Early stopping mechanisms\n",
    "   - Client-side customization:\n",
    "     - Local training optimization\n",
    "     - Site-specific parameters\n",
    "     - Custom data handling\n",
    "\n",
    "These fundamentals prepare you for more advanced FL concepts and implementations in the following chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move on to [Chapter 2](../../chapter-2_develop_federated_learning_applications/02.0_introduction/introduction.ipynb)"
