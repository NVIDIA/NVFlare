    "# Simple ML/DL to FL transition with NVFlare\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting Deep Learning (DL) models to Federated Learning (FL) entails several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Formulating the algorithm: This involves determining how to adapt a DL model into an FL framework, including specifying the information exchange protocol between the server and clients.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Code conversion: Adapting existing standalone DL code into FL-compatible code. This typically involves minimal changes, often just a few lines of code, thanks to tools like NVFlare.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Workflow configuration: Once the code is modified, configuring the workflow to integrate the newly adapted FL code seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "NVFlare simplifies the process of transitioning from traditional Machine Learning (ML) or DL algorithms to FL. With NVFlare, the conversion process requires only minor code adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we have the following three examples for converting traditional ML to FL:\n",
