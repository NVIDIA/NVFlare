    "## Introduction to Scikit-learn, tabular data, and federated k-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scikit-learn\n",
    "This example shows how to use [NVIDIA FLARE](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/index.html) on tabular data.\n",
    "It uses [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/),\n",
    "a widely used open-source machine learning library that supports supervised \n",
    "and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "### Tabular data\n",
    "The data used in this example is tabular in a format that can be handled by [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), such that:\n",
    "- rows correspond to data samples\n",
    "- the first column represents the label \n",
    "- the other columns cover the features.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Each client is expected to have one local data file containing both training \n",
    "and validation samples. To load the data for each client, the following \n",
    "parameters are expected by the local learner:\n",
    "- data_file_path: string, the full path to the client's data file \n",
    "- train_start: int, start row index for the training set\n",
    "- train_end: int, end row index for the training set\n",
    "- valid_start: int, start row index for the validation set\n",
    "- valid_end: int, end row index for the validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Federated k-Means clustering\n",
    "The machine learning algorithm in this example is [k-Means clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregation follows the scheme defined in [Mini-batch k-Means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.MiniBatchKMeans.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Under this setting, each round of federated learning can be formulated as follows:\n",
    "- local training: starting from global centers, each client trains a local MiniBatchKMeans model with their own data\n",
    "- global aggregation: server collects the cluster center, \n",
    "  counts information from all clients, aggregates them by considering \n",
    "  each client's results as a mini-batch, and updates the global center and per-center counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For center initialization, at the first round, each client generates its initial centers with the k-means++ method. Then, the server collects all initial centers and performs one round of k-means to generate the initial global center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we listed steps to run this example."
