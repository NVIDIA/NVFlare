    "# Summary of Chapter 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We covered developing federated learning applications in Chapter 2. Here is an overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Federated Statistics**\n",
    "    - **Federated Statistics with Image Data**: How to compute local and global image statistics with the consideration that data is private at each of the client sites.\n",
    "        - [federated_statistics_with_image_data.ipynb](../02.1_federated_statistics/federated_statistics_with_image_data/federated_statistics_with_image_data.ipynb)\n",
    "    - **Federated Statistics with Tabular Data**: How to create federated statistics for data that can be represented as Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "        - [federated_statistics_with_tabular_data.ipynb](../02.1_federated_statistics/federated_statistics_with_tabular_data/federated_statistics_with_tabular_data.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Converting PyTorch Lightning to FL**\n",
    "    - **PyTorch Lightning to FL**: Guide on converting PyTorch Lightning scripts to federated learning.\n",
    "        - [convert_torch_lightning_to_fl.ipynb](../02.2_convert_torch_lightning_to_federated_learning/convert_torch_lightning_to_fl.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simple ML/DL to FL transition with NVFlare**\n",
    "    - **Converting Logistic Regression to FL**: How to implement a federated binary classification via logistic regression with second-order Newton-Raphson optimization. \n",
    "        - [convert_logistic_regression_to_fl.ipynb](../02.3_convert_machine_learning_to_federated_learning/02.3.1_convert_logistic_regression_to_federated_learning/convert_logistic_regression_to_fl.ipynb)\n",
    "    - **Converting KMeans to FL**: ADD CONTENT HERE. \n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Client API**\n",
    "    - **Client API**: Here we focus on the core concepts of the Client API and explain how to configure it to run within the same process or in a separate subprocess. \n",
    "        - [client_api.ipynb](../02.4_client_api/client_api.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recap of Covered Topics**\n",
    "    - **Summary and Recap**: A recap of the topics covered in the previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section is designed to provide comprehensive guidance and practical examples to help you implement and customize federated learning in your applications. For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the respective notebooks linked in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move on to the [Chapter 3](../../../part-2_federated_learning_system/chapter-3_federated_computing_platform/03.0_introduction/introduction.ipynb)."
