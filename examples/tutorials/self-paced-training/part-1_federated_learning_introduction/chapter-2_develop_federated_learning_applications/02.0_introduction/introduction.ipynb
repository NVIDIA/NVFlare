    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore the process of developing federated learning applications. \n",
    "We will essentially cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Federated Analytics\n",
    "   * discover the federated statistics of local and global data\n",
    "   * visualize the federated statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert deep learning code to Federated Learning code\n",
    "\n",
    "   we already covered converting the PyTorch code to Federated Learning code in the previous chapter, now we will cover: \n",
    "   * convert PyTorch Lightning code to Federated Learning code\n",
