    "# Develop Federated Learning Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore the process of developing federated learning applications. \n",
    "We will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Federated Analytics\n",
    "   * Discover the federated statistics of local and global data\n",
    "   * Visualize the federated statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert deep learning code to Federated Learning code\n",
    "\n",
    "   We already covered converting PyTorch code to Federated Learning code in the previous chapter. Now we will cover: \n",
    "   * Converting PyTorch Lightning code to Federated Learning code\n",
    "   * Converting TensorFlow code to Federated Learning code\n",
    "   \n",
