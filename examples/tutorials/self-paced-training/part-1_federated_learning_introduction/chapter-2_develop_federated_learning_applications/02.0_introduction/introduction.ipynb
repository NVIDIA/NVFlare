    "# Introduction: Develop Federated Learning Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore the process of developing federated learning applications. We will start by exploring federated statistics and getting different visualizations from the data. We will then convert PyTorch Lightning code for use with NVFlare. We will then examine machine learning algorithms and look at how to convert logistics regression, kmeans, and survival analysis for use with federated learning. Finally, we will look into the Client API and conclude with a recap of the covered topics.\n",
