    "# Customizing Federated Learning Server logics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous sections, we are able to run federated pytorch image classification code with NVIDIA FLARE builtin FedAvg algorithm. \n",
    "What if we want to build my own algorithms or modify the existing algorithm ? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, using FedAvg as starting point, we like to make a few changes to FedAvg to fit our needs: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Add early stopping mechanism so that the training could stop instead of waiting to the total numbers of rounds if the criteria is statisfied\n",
    "* Instead of rely on the internal best model selection approach, we want to provide our own best model selection\n",
    "* Instead of using building persiste component PTFileModelPersistor, we like to have our own save and loading functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will go over these changes step-by-step. \n",

    "\n",
    "FedAvg can be written as very simple for-loop. There are several other factors to consider \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's dive into these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transfer Structure: FLModel\n",
    "\n",
    "FLARE defined a high-level data structure \"FLModel\" that holds the model parameters, metrics and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "class ParamsType(str, Enum):\n",
    "    FULL = \"FULL\"\n",
    "    DIFF = \"DIFF\"\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "the data can be packaged into FLModel transfer between clients and server as well as among clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Serialization \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the deep learning machine frameworks using python pickle as default serrialization mechanism. There are enough security concerns that FLARE is not using Pickle. NVIDIA FLARE Object Serializer (FOBS) used a [messagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html)-based serialization approach. \n",
    "User needs to register a component ( \"Decomposer\") to serialize/de-serialize certain project to fobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To PyTorch Tensor, we need to register [TensorDecompressor](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/nvflare/app_opt/pt/decomposers.py) component at FOBS. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "            # Use FOBS for serializing/deserializing PyTorch tensors\n",
    "            fobs.register(TensorDecomposer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Send and Recieve Object\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-level API, we can use the followings\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   results = self.send_model_and_wait(targets=clients, data=model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "the function send the FLModel to targeted clients and recieve result. This is synchornized methood like scatter and gather. We broadcast the model to all targeted clients and receive results when required clients send back the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The BasedFedAvg is derived from ModelController which has the communication component, which allows the component to send the model and wait for result. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are covered these few factors, lets write a class and see how it will look\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with BaseFedAvg class. ```class BaseFedAvg``` provided a core based class for the customize FedAvg, it define a run() methods that capture all the running logs\n",
    "as well as some utiliies. We can look at the initial version of the code\n",
