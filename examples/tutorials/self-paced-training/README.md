  Understand federated learning and decentralized training concepts.
- **System Architecture:**  
  Learn about NVIDIA FLARE system architecture, deployment, and user interactions.
- **Privacy & Security:**  
  Explore privacy and security challenges, solutions, and enterprise-grade protections.
- **Advanced Topics:**  
  Dive into algorithms (FedOpt, FedProx, etc.), workflows (cyclic, split, swarm), LLM training, and XGBoost.
- **Industry Applications:**  
  Discover real-world use in healthcare, life sciences, and finance.
- **Practical Skills:**  
  Transition from standard ML code to federated workflows; customize client/server logic, job structure, and configuration.
- **Comprehensive Resources:**  
  Access over 100 notebooks and 88 videos for a thorough learning experience.

> **Tip:**  
> While each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently, for best results, follow the sequence to build a strong foundation.
