    "# Simulating Real-World Deployment with NVIDIA FLARE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1 of this course, we used the NVIDIA FLARE simulator to run federated learning experiments without worrying about system deployment. While the simulator is excellent for algorithm development and testing, real-world federated learning deployments involve multiple physical sites, each with its own infrastructure and security requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment by using NVIDIA FLARE's Proof of Concept (POC) mode. This mode allows us to simulate a multi-site deployment on a single machine, providing a realistic preview of how federated learning works in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the difference between simulation and real-world deployment\n",
    "- Set up a Proof of Concept (POC) environment to simulate multi-site deployment\n",
    "- Configure a federated learning project with custom sites and users\n",
    "- Start and manage a federated learning system in POC mode\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Deployment vs. Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first understand the key differences between the simulator we used previously and a real-world deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Simulator | Real-World Deployment |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|----------------------|\n",
    "| Infrastructure | Single process with multiple threads | Multiple machines across different organizations |\n",
    "| Setup | Simple Python API or CLI command | Multi-step process including provisioning and distribution |\n",
    "| Security | Minimal (for development) | Comprehensive (certificates, encryption, authentication) |\n",
    "| Communication | In-memory | Network-based (gRPC, HTTP, etc.) |\n",
    "| Lifecycle | Starts and stops with your script | Long-running services waiting for jobs |\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Real-World Deployment Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In a production environment, deploying a federated learning system typically involves these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Provisioning**: Creating secure software packages (startup kits) for each participant\n",
    "2. **Distribution**: Securely transferring these packages to each participating site\n",
    "3. **Startup**: Each site starts their FLARE client/server using the startup kit\n",
    "4. **Operation**: The system runs continuously, processing jobs as they're submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "The Proof of Concept (POC) mode allows us to simulate this entire process on a single machine, making it an excellent learning tool before moving to a distributed deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare the key differences between the POC simulated deployment and a real-world deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Simulator | Real-World Deployment |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|----------------------|\n",
    "| Infrastructure | Client and server run different process on the same machine (localhost) | Clients and servers on multiple machines across different organizations |\n",
    "| Setup | poc command uses provision to create startup kits, but make everything run on the same machine, no distribution | provision and distribution process |\n",
    "| Security | Minimal (for development) | Comprehensive (certificates, encryption, authentication) |\n",
    "| Communication | Network-based (gRPC, HTTP, etc.) | Network-based (gRPC, HTTP, etc.) |\n",
    "| Lifecycle | Long-running services waiting for jobs| Long-running services waiting for jobs |\n",

    "- Configure a custom project with specific sites and user roles\n",

    "- Start and manage the components of a federated learning system using various command options\n",
    "- Understand the relationship between POC mode and real-world deployment\n",
