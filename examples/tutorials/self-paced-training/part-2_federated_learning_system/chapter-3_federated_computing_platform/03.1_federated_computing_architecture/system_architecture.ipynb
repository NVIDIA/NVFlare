    "\n",
    "NVIDIA FLARE is built using a layered architecture, where each layer provides specific functionality and builds upon the layers below it. This design enables modularity, extensibility, and separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./flare_overview.png\" alt=\"FLARE Architecture\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore each layer from bottom to top:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Network Communication Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "At the foundation of NVIDIA FLARE is the network communication layer, which handles all data exchange between participants in the federated system.\n",

    "- **Data governance**: Enforcing policies on what data can be shared\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Federated Workflow Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer implements specific patterns for federated execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some of the supported workflows:**\n",
    "- **Scatter and Gather (SAG)**: The classic federated learning pattern\n",
    "- **Cyclic**: Sequential training across clients\n",
    "- **Cross-site Evaluation**: Evaluating models across different sites\n",
    "- **Swarm Learning**: Peer-to-peer federated learning\n",
    "- **Federated Analytics**: Analyzing distributed data without sharing raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Programming APIs Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer provides interfaces for developers to interact with the NVIDIA FLARE system at different levels of abstraction.\n",

    "## FLARE Communication Interface (FCI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The FLARE Communication Interface (FCI) is a critical component that deserves special attention. It provides the foundation for all communication in the federated system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is FCI?\n",
    "\n",
    "FCI is a logical network framework that supports asynchronous, two-way communication through multiple transport mechanisms. It's designed to be flexible, efficient, and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Capabilities of FCI\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pluggable Architecture**: Supports different messaging patterns (request-response, broadcast, pub/sub) and transport mechanisms (TCP, Pipe, HTTP/WS, gRPC) through drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficient Streaming**: Large binary data can be streamed in small chunks to minimize memory usage\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Full-duplex Communication**: Both sides can send messages to each other without polling (if the transport supports it)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multiplexing**: Multiple conversations can occur over the same connection simultaneously using stream IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Asynchronous Messaging**: Can send/receive messages asynchronously (fire-and-forget, message listening)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client-Initiated Connections**: All TCP-based connections can be initiated from clients, eliminating the need for clients to expose ports\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inter-Process Communication**: Works with communications through pipes or sockets between processes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Built-in Heartbeats**: Maintains connection health through heartbeat mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "### FCI Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "FCI itself has a layered architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./fci.png\" alt=\"FLARE Communication Interface\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API Layer**: Exposes interfaces like Communicator and Cellnet to application developers\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Streamable Framed Message (SFM)**: The core of FCI that provides abstraction over different communication protocols and manages endpoints and connections\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transport Drivers**: Responsible for sending frames to other endpoints, treating frames as opaque bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this important?** The pluggable nature of FCI means you can switch transport drivers without affecting the application layers. This provides flexibility in deployment and allows for adaptation to different network environments and security requirements."

    "## Federated Job Processing Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA FLARE uses a job-based architecture to manage federated workflows. This design enables concurrent execution of multiple federated tasks and provides isolation between different workflows.\n",

    "<img src=\"./system_architecture.png\" alt=\"FLARE System Architecture\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\">\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Parent Control Processes**: Each site (server and clients) has a parent control process that manages job execution\n",

    "* **Job Processes**: Individual jobs run in separate processes, providing isolation and resource management\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Job Scheduler**: Allocates resources and manages job execution based on priorities and resource availability\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Job Monitor**: Tracks job status and performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of the Job Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concurrency**: Multiple jobs can run simultaneously\n",
    "* **Isolation**: Jobs are isolated from each other, preventing interference\n",
    "* **Resource Management**: Resources can be allocated based on job requirements\n",
    "* **Fault Tolerance**: Failures in one job don't affect others\n",
    "* **Lifecycle Management**: Jobs can be started, paused, resumed, and terminated independently\n",
    "\n",
    "## Event-Based System\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA FLARE uses an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct method calls. This design enables loose coupling and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "* All NVIDIA FLARE components (derived from FLComponent) can handle and fire events via the runtime engine\n",
    "* Components can register to listen for specific events\n",
    "* When an event occurs, all registered listeners are notified\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extensibility**: New functionality can be added by creating components that listen for existing events\n",
    "* **Loose Coupling**: Components don't need direct knowledge of each other\n",
    "* **Customization**: Users can write custom FLComponents as plugins to listen for events and implement specialized logic at any layer"
