    "NVIDIA FLARE is built in layers. Each layer is built on top of the next. At the bottom layer is the network communication layer.\n",

    "## FCI - Flare Communication Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "FCI is a logical network framework that supports asynchronous, 2-way communication through multiple transports. It is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pluggable**: It has a pluggable architecture to support different messaging patterns (request-response, broadcast, pub/sub). It can also support different transports through drivers, like TCP, Pipe, HTTP/WS, gRPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Streamable**: Large binary data can be streamed in small chunks to minimize memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Full-duplex**: Both sides can send messages to each other without polling, if the transport supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multiplex**: Multiple conversations can be conducted over the same connection at the same time using stream IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Asynchronous**: Can send/receive messages in an asynchronous fashion like fire/forget, listen to messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-way connection** for remote communications: All TCP-based connections can be initiated from clients so clients have no port exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supports IPC**: It can work with communications through pipes or sockets between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Native heartbeats**: Heartbeats are supported by FCI to keep connections alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "From top to bottom, FCI has the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API Layer**: This is the API exposed to application developers, like Communicator and Cellnet.\n",
    "* **Streamable Framed Message (SFM)**: This is the core of FCI and it provides abstraction on top of different communication protocols. It manages endpoints and connections.\n",
    "* **Transport Drivers**: This layer is responsible for sending frames to other endpoints. It treats the frame as opaque bytes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the basic core concepts, we have built many Federated learning workflows including FedAvg, FedOpt, FedProx, Scaffold, cyclic, swarming learning, split learning algorithms with many examples which can be found on the [website](https://nvidia.github.io/NVFlare/) and its [tutorial categories](https://nvidia.github.io/NVFlare/catalog/).\n",

    "## Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "We have built different tools for simulation including Python API and CLI. You have seen the Job API and simulator CLI in [Chapter-1](../../../part-1_federated_learning_introduction/Chapter-1_running_federated_learning_applications/01.0_introduction/introduction.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Section 3.2](../03.2_deployment_simulation/simulate_real_world_deployment.ipynb), we will also discuss how to simulate the deployment within a local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the federated computing system is not a trivial task. We have built tools to make this process simpler. We will discuss this in [Chapter 4](../../chapter-4_setup_federated_system/04.0_introduction/introduction.ipynb).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **ModelController and Client API** -- This is higher level API based on the assumption that for many machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we can use the FLModel data structure to capture the input and output. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Job API** -- FLARE Job API is a way to generate job configuration. Although once can direct edit configuration files, one can also use the Job API to construct the needed components and generate the job configuration. The job API can also call job.simulate_run()  -- which is combined step of export job configuration and call simulator run. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FLARE API** -- FLARE python API is equivallent FLARE Console command API. Instead of interact with FL system via Console command, we can perform most of the command functions via FLARE API. These includes connect to the server, checking status, monitoring jobs, submit job etc. \n",
