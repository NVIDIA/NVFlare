    "\n",
    "FCI is a logical network framework that supports asynchronous, 2-way communication through multiple transports. It is \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pluggable**. It should have a pluggable architecture so it can support different messaging patterns (request-response, broadcast, pub/sub). It can also support different transport through drivers, like TCP, Pipe, HTTP/WS, gRPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Streamable**. Large binary data can be streamed in small chunks to minimize memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Full-duplex**. Both sides can send messages to each other without polling, if transport supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multiplex**, Multiple conversations can be conducted over the same connection at the same time using stream IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Asynchronous**. Can send/receive messages in asynchronous fashion like fire/forget, listen to messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-way connection** for remote communications. All TCP-based connections can be initiated from clients so clients have no port exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supports IPC**. It can work with communications through pipes or sockets between processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Native heartbeats**. Heartbeats are supported by FCI to keep connections alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "From top to bottom, FCI has following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API Layer**: This is the API exposed to application developers, like Communicator and Cellnet.\n",
    "* **Streamable Framed Message (SFM)**: This is the core of FCI and it provides abstraction on top of different communication protocols. It manages endpoints and connections.\n",
    "* **Transport Drivers**: This layer is responsible for sending frames to other endpoints. It treats the frame as opaque bytes. \n",

    "Based on the basic core concepts, we have built many Federated learning workflows including FedAvg, FedOpt, FedProx, Scoffold, cyclic, swarming learning, split learning algorithms with many examples which can be found in [website](https://nvidia.github.io/NVFlare/) and its [tutorial categories](https://nvidia.github.io/NVFlare/catalog/)\n",
