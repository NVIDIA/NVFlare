    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a federated learning system up and running, you need ways to interact with it—to submit jobs, monitor progress, retrieve results, and manage participants. NVIDIA FLARE provides three primary methods for system interaction, each suited to different use cases and preferences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FLARE Admin Console**: An interactive command-line interface for system administrators\n",
    "2. **FLARE Python API**: Programmatic access for integration with applications and workflows\n",
    "3. **FLARE Job CLI**: Command-line tools for job management\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore each of these interaction methods, demonstrating how to perform common tasks with each approach. By understanding these options, you'll be able to choose the most appropriate method for your specific needs and integrate NVIDIA FLARE into your existing workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Identify the three main methods for interacting with NVIDIA FLARE\n",
    "- Use the FLARE Admin Console to manage federated learning jobs\n",
    "- Implement the FLARE Python API to programmatically control the system\n",
    "- Utilize the FLARE Job CLI for command-line job management\n",
    "- Monitor and manage jobs through different interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing a Sample Job\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the different interaction methods, let's prepare a sample job that we can use throughout this section. We'll use a CIFAR-10 image classification task similar to what we've seen in previous chapters.\n",
