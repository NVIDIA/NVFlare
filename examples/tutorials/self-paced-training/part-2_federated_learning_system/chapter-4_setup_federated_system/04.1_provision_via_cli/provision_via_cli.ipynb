    "This section is a crucial part that defines all the [participants](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/provisioning_system.html#participant) involved in the project. There are multiple types of participants defined in FLARE, most common types include `server`, `client` and `admin`. Some participants are referred to as [sites](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/user_guide/security/terminologies_and_roles.html#site), which represent computing systems that run FLARE applications, for instance, the `server` and `client`. While some participants are referred to as [users](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/user_guide/security/terminologies_and_roles.html#user), who are human participants, with different access priviledges to query, monitor or manage the project, for instance, the `admin`. Developers can also include other types, like the `overseer` for high-availability mode, or add custom types - we will not cover the details of these advanced features in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, in the `project.yml` file, the following participants are defined:\n",
    "- 1 `server`: the name of the server should in general be a [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) (FQDN) to make sure that other participants can establish network connections to the server from any location. The server name can also be a system-wide known hostname.\n",
    "- 2 `client`s with names `site-1` and `site-2`.\n",
    "- 1 `admin`: here we defined 1 `project_admin` with name `admin@nvidia.com`, who has the most elevated access priviledges in the whole project. There can only 1 project admin for each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Builders**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NVIDIA FLARE provisioning, [builders](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/provisioning_system.html#builder) are a series of Python classes that work together to generate startup kits for all participants, based on the configurations defined in the project configuration file. Builders create various aspects of the startup kits for all participants, such as workspace structure, configuration files, and security credentials. Builders specified in a configuration file will be invoked in the same order as listed in the `builders` section. This example `project.yml` file shows the usage of common builders:\n",
    "- `WorkspaceBuilder`: Creates the basic workspace structure\n",
    "- `StaticFileBuilder`: Copies static files into the workspace\n",
    "- `CertBuilder`: Generates certificates and keys for secure communication\n",
    "- `SignatureBuilder`: Creates signatures for tamper-proofing\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers can also create custom builders to construct more specific and customized provisioning output. We will not deep dive into how builders work and how they can be customized. For now, the most important thing to know about builders is that they execute in specific order to build the startup kits as results of a provisioning process."

In general, each site should have an organization admin to receive or download the startup kits. The organization admin can then install their own packages, start the services, map the data location, and instrument the authorization policies and organization level site privacy policies. Another way to distribute startup kits is to use the [FLARE Dashboard](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/user_guide/dashboard_ui.html) with a convenient webUI.
