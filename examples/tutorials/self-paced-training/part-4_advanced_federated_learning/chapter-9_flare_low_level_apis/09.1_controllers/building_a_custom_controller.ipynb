    "### The controller\n",
    "\n",
    "In NVFlare, a `Controller` is a server-side component that manages the job execution and orchestration of tasks. Here, since we're running a P2P algorithm, we'll implement a custom controller whose main job is to load and broadcast the network configuration, and initiate/terminate the execution of a P2P distributed optimization algorithm. Let's call it `DistOptController`. As a subclass of `Controller`, it must implement 3 methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start_controller` which is called at the beginning of the run\n",
    "- `control_flow` defining the main control flow of the controller (in this case, broadcasting the configuration and asking clients to run the algorithm)\n",
    "- `stop_controller`, called at the end of the run\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nvflare.apis.impl.controller import Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "class DistOptController(Controller):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def control_flow(self, abort_signal: Signal, fl_ctx: FLContext):\n",
    "        # Broadcast configuration to clients\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Run the algorithm\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_controller(self, fl_ctx: FLContext):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def stop_controller(self, fl_ctx: FLContext):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't do anything fancy during the start and stop phase, so let's focus on the `control_flow` and implement the two steps. To do so, we first need to override the `__init__` method to take a `Config` object as an argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nvflare.app_opt.p2p.types import Config\n",
    "\n",
    "class DistOptController(Controller):\n",
    "    def __init__(\n",
    "        self,\n",
    "        config: Config,\n",
    "        *args,\n",
    "        **kwargs,\n",
    "    ):\n",
    "        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        self.config = config\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in the `control_flow` method we can send the local configurations to each client and, once they receive them, ask them to run the algorithm. We'll do so by sending `Task`s to each client. In NVFlare, a `Task` is a piece of work that is assigned by the Controller to client workers. Depending on how the task is assigned (broadcast, send, or relay), the task will be performed by one or more clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, on one hand, we'll use the `send_and_wait` method to send the `\"config\"` task to each client, since each client will potentially have a different config (because of different neighbors); on the other hand, to run the algorith, we'll use the `broadcast_and_wait`, which broadcasts the same `\"run_algorithm\"` task to all clients and waits for all clients to respond/complete the task. As you see, each task specifies a `name` - in this case, `\"config\"` and `\"run_algorithm\"` - let's remember those as they'll need to be the same in the control flow of each client.\n",
