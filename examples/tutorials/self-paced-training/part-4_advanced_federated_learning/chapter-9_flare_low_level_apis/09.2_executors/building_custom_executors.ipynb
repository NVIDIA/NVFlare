    "# Building a custom Executor in NVFlare\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our `DistOptController`, it's time to take care of the actual execution of the algorithm at the client level.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to build a custom executor on top of the NVFlare `Executor` for performing a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) distributed optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In NVFlare, an `Executor` is a client-side component that processes tasks received from the controller and executes them accordingly. In our P2P algorithm, the custom executor's main responsibilities are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Receiving the configuration from the server/controller.\n",
    "- Communicating with its neighbors, sending and receiving messages.\n",
    "- Running the algorithm, performing computations and coordinating with other clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a custom executor named `SyncAlgorithmExecutor` by subclassing the base `Executor` class provided by NVFlare.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Like the `Controller`, an `Executor` is also a subclass of `FLComponent`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add some extra complexity, we'll focus on synchronous algorithms only, meaning that the clients will need to implement some sort of synchronization mechaniscm to execute iterations of the algorithm in a synchronous way. \n",
    "We'll call our executor `SyncAlgorithmExecutor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing the Executor\n",
    "\n",
    "### More key components\n",
    "Before we dive into the implementation, let's understand some key components and methods we'll use. This will help in comprehending how everything fits together. Beyond the `FLContext`, `Signal`, `Shareable` and `DXO` that we saw in the previous notebook, we'll make use of [aux channels](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/2.5/apidocs/nvflare.private.aux_runner.html#nvflare.private.aux_runner.AuxRunner.send_aux_request) to send messages between clients. In particular we'll see two methods in use:\n",
    "- [`send_aux_request`](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/2.5/apidocs/nvflare.private.fed.client.client_engine_executor_spec.html#nvflare.private.fed.client.client_engine_executor_spec.ClientEngineExecutorSpec.send_aux_request): A method used to send auxiliary (non-primary) messages between clients (or between clients and server). It's part of the communication mechanism in NVFlare for client-to-client or client-to-server communication outside the main task flow. It requires to specify a list of `targets`, a `topic`, a `request` (a `Shareable` to send) and a `timeout` (i.e., the number of seconds to wait for replies).\n",
    "- `register_aux_message_handler`: A method to be used used to register a callback function that handles auxiliary messages for a specific `topic`. This specifies how clients can respond to messages sent via `send_aux_request`. It requires two arguments: the `topic` to be handled, and a callable function to handle the message `message_handle_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that both methods are natively available to the `Executor` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we'll use Python's `threading.Event` and `threading.Lock` to synchronize execution and ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing the `SyncAlgorithmExecutor`\n",
    "For our purposes, we'll need our executor to be able to do a few things:\n",
    "- Receive the configuration from the server/controller.\n",
    "- Communicate with its neighbors and send/receive messages to/from them.\n",
    "- Run the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary method we need to implement is the `execute` method, which processes tasks received from the controller. This method takes the `task_name`, a `shareable` (data sent from the controller), the `fl_ctx` (federated learning context), and an `abort_signal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Structure\n",
    "Here's the basic structure of our executor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nvflare.apis.executor import Executor\n",
    "from nvflare.apis.fl_constant import ReturnCode\n",
    "from nvflare.apis.fl_context import FLContext\n",
    "from nvflare.apis.shareable import Shareable, make_reply\n",
    "from nvflare.apis.signal import Signal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class SyncAlgorithmExecutor(Executor):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def execute(\n",
    "        self,\n",
    "        task_name: str,\n",
    "        shareable: Shareable,\n",
    "        fl_ctx: FLContext,\n",
    "        abort_signal: Signal,\n",
    "    ):\n",
    "        if task_name == \"config\":\n",
    "            # TODO: receive and store config\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "            return make_reply(ReturnCode.OK)\n",
    "        elif task_name == \"run_algorithm\":\n",
    "            # TODO: run the algorithm\n",
    "            return make_reply(ReturnCode.OK)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.log_warning(fl_ctx, f\"Unknown task name: {task_name}\")\n",
    "            return make_reply(ReturnCode.TASK_UNKNOWN)\n",
    "```\n",
    "As mentioned, the `execute` method handles the execution of tasks based on the `task_name`. Remember, that, many times, when a controller sends a task, it waits to receive some response back - so, this method should also return a `Shareable` object, here created using `make_reply`, which includes a `ReturnCode` indicating the result of the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling the `\"config\"` task\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's focus on handling the `\"config\"` task first. We need to receive configuration data from the server and store it locally. We'll also initialize attributes to store the configuration and the neighbors' information.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nvflare.apis.dxo import from_shareable\n",
    "from nvdo.types import LocalConfig, Neighbor\n",

    "        self._weight = None\n",

    "            # Receive and store config\n",
    "            self.config = LocalConfig(**from_shareable(shareable).data)\n",
    "            self.neighbors = self.config.neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "            # Compute local weight (this depends on the algorithm)\n",
    "            self._weight = 1.0 - sum([n.weight for n in self.neighbors])\n",
    "\n",
    "            return make_reply(ReturnCode.OK)\n",
    "\n",
    "        elif task_name == \"run_algorithm\":\n",

    "            return make_reply(ReturnCode.TASK_UNKNOWN)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're using a few additional components:\n",
    "- `from_shareable`: Converts a `Shareable` back into a `DXO`. This is useful to easily extract the actual data payload from the shareable received from the server (in this case containing the configuration data dictionary).\n",
    "- `LocalConfig`: A data structure we defined in the [introduction](../09.0_introduction/introduction.ipynb) to store the client's local configuration, including neighbors in a pythonic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication between clients\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous step was relatively easy.\n",
    "Now, we'll handle the more challenging part: enabling clients to communicate with each other. This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sending messages to neighbors: Using `send_aux_request` to send messages to neighboring clients.\n",
    "- Receiving messages from neighbors: Registering a callback function to handle incoming messages via `register_aux_message_handler`. We'll call the callback `_handle_neighbor_value` and the registration will be done in the `handle_event` method at start time (i.e., when receiving the `EventType.START_RUN` event). Other events can be handled in the same way if needed.\n",
    "- Synchronizing execution: Using threading events and locks to coordinate the execution of the algorithm.\n",
    "- Handling message formats: Implementing methods to serialize and deserialize messages (this is useful, for example, to send torch tensors). We'll add two methods, `_from_message` and `_to_message` to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main message exchange will be done in the `_exchange_values` function. Let's first look at the implementation and then we'll discuss it in detail.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's break down the key components of this implementation:\n",
    "- Additional parameters:\n",
    "    - `sync_waiter` (threading.Event): An event that allows threads to wait until it is set. Used here to synchronize the execution of the algorithm, making clients wait until all neighbor values have been received.\n",
    "    - `lock` (threading.Lock): Ensures thread-safe access to shared data structures, such as neighbors_values.\n",
    "    - `neighbors_values`: A dictionary that stores received values from neighbors, organized by iteration.\n",
    "- `_exchange_values`: a custom method to handle the exchange of values with neighbors during each iteration. It follows the following process:\n",
    "    1. Clears the `sync_waiter` event to ensure we're starting fresh.\n",
    "    2. Sends an auxiliary request to each neighbor with the current value and iteration number.\n",
    "    3. Checks if all neighbor values have been received; if not, waits for `sync_waiter` to be set or times out after 10 seconds.\n",
    "    4. Handling Timeout: If the required neighbor values are not received within the timeout, the method calls `system_panic` to handle the error (usually logging and cleanup).\n",
    "- `_handle_neighbor_value`: a custom callback to handle incoming messages from neighbors containing their values. It works by:\n",
    "    1. Extracting the sender's identity and the data from the request.\n",
    "    2. Storing the received value in `neighbors_values` under the appropriate iteration.\n",
    "    3. Checking if all neighbor values for the iteration have been received; if so, sets `sync_waiter` to release any waiting threads.\n",
    "    4. Thread Safety: Uses a `lock` to ensure that the update to `neighbors_values` and the check is atomic.\n",
    "- `handle_event`: implement the `handle_event` of the base `Executor` to handle events sent by the engine. In this case. when `EventType.START_RUN` (i.e. when the run )starts, we register the auxiliary message handler for receiving neighbor values.\n",
    "- `_to_message` and `_from_message`: custom placeholder methods for serializing and deserializing the message content. In subclasses, you might need to override these methods to handle complex data structures or use specific serialization formats (e.g., converting tensors to and from bytes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Notice that `neighbors_values` needs to maintain a dictionary of received values per iteration. This is because, different parts of a network may be at different iterations of the algorithm (plus or minus 1 at most) - this means that I could receive a message from a neighbor valid for iteration `t+1` when I'm still at iteration `t`. Since that message won't be sent again, I need to store it. **To avoid the `neighbors_values` to grow indefinitely, we'll delete its content at iteration `t` after having consumed its values and moving to the next iteration in the algorithm**. This can be done by `del self.neighbors_values[iteration]` after we're done with an iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running the algorithm\n",
    "\n",

It contains a few additional attributes (namely `self.id` and `self.client_name`) to identify the client, which are potentially useful in algorithms, and two additional methods `_pre_algorithm_run` and `_post_algorithm_run` to be overridden by each specific algorithm to execute some code before and after the algorithm execution, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Consensus Algorithm Overview\n",
    "The consensus algorithm allows clients to reach agreement on a certain value through iterative averaging with their neighbors. Each client updates its value based on its own value and the values received from its neighbors, weighted accordingly. In formulas, each client $i$ maintains some local value $x_i^t$ and is connected to a subset of the other clients in the network, defined as the set of its neighbors $\\mathcal{N}_i$.\n",
    "The goal of all the clients is to reach consensus on their local values by communicating with their peers for a certain number of iterations $T$. \n",
    "In other terms, they want to cooperatively compute a weighted average of their initial values $x_i^0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consensus algorithm works by having each client updating its local value as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i^{t+1} = \\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{N}_i}a_{ji}x_j^t$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- Initialization:\n",
    "    - Sets an initial random value if none is provided.\n",
    "    - Initializes `current_value` and `value_history` to keep track of the values over iterations.\n",
    "- `run_algorithm`:\n",
    "    - Retrieves the number of iterations from the shareable received.\n",
    "    - For each iteration:\n",
    "        1. Abort check: Checks if an abort signal has been triggered.\n",
    "        2. Exchange values: Calls `_exchange_values` to send and receive values with neighbors.\n",
    "        3. Compute new value by computing the weighted average of the current value and the received values from neighbors.\n",
    "        4. Update state (`current_value`) and store value in `value_history`\n",
    "        5. Cleanup: Deletes the neighbor values for the iteration to free up memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Our custom `SyncAlgorithmExecutor` and the example `ConsensusExecutor` demonstrate how to implement client-side logic for a P2P federated learning algorithm in NVFlare. The key steps involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling tasks received from the controller.\n",
    "- Exchanging messages with neighbors using auxiliary communication methods.\n",
    "- Synchronizing execution using threading primitives.\n",
    "- Implementing the algorithm logic in the run_algorithm method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full implementation of the `SyncAlgorithmExecutor` can be found in `nvflare/app_opt/p2p/executors/sync_executor.py`, and the `ConsensusExecutor` is implemented in `nvflare/app_opt/p2p/executors/consensus.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to explore the `nvflare.app_opt.p2p` module to see how other algorithms are implemented and to build your own custom executors based on this template."
