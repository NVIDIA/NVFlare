    "### The executor\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our `DistOptController`, it's time to take care of the actual execution of the algorithm at the client level - we'll build on top of the NVFlare `Executor` to do to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NVFlare, an `Executor` is a client-side component that handles tasks received from the controller and executes them. For our purposes we'll need our executor to be able to do a few things:\n",
    "- receive the config from the server/controller\n",
    "- communicate with its neighbors and send/receive messages to/from them\n",
    "- run the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment, we'll focus on synchronous algorithms only, meaning that the clients will need to run the iterations of an algorithm in a synchronous way. Let' call our executor `SyncAlgorithmExecutor`.\n",
    "The only method that must be implemented in this case is the `execute` method, which takes the `task_name` and `shareable` sent from the controller as inputs.\n",

    "That was relatively easy - so, now to the slightly more challenging part of letting clients communicate with each other.\n",
    "To do that we'll do a few things:\n",
    "- we'll use the `send_aux_request` method to let a client send a message to its neighbors\n",
    "- we'll need to register a callback to handle received messages (via the `register_aux_message_handler` function) and add an attribute `neighbors_values` to store received values. We'll call the callback `_handle_neighbor_value` and the registration will be done in the `handle_event` method at start time (i.e., when receiving the `EventType.START_RUN` event). Other events can be handled in the same way if needed.\n",
    "- we'll use threading events and locks to synchronize the execution of the algorithm (making each client, when sending a message, wait to have received the messages of all its neighbors before sending the next message)\n",
    "- we'll add two methods, `_from_message` and `_to_message` to convert between the message exchange formats (which will need to be overridden in subclasses, based on the algorithm)\n",

    "That's it for the synchronous message exchange. Notice that `neighbors_values` needs to maintain a dictionary of received values per iteration. \n",
    "This is because, different parts of a network may be at different iterations of the algorithm (plus or minus 1 at most) - this means that I could receive a message from a neighbor valid for iteration `t+1` when I'm still at iteration `t`. Since that message won't be sent again, I need to store it. To avoid the `neighbors_values` to grow indefinitely, we'll delete its content at iteration `t` after having consumed its values and moving to the next iteration in the algorithm. We'll see that in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, now that we have a way to store the config and exchange messages with the neighbors, we can move on to implementing the algorithmic part. For this base `SyncAlgorithmExecutor`, we'll just implement the main logic in the `execute` method, based on an abstract `run_algorithm` to be overridden by each specific algorithm.\n",

It contains a few additional attributes (namely `self.id` and `self.client_name`) to identify the client, which are potentially useful in algorithms, and two additional methods `_pre_algorithm_run` and `_post_algorithm_run` to be overridden by each specific algorithm to execute some code before and after the algorithm execution, respectively.\n",
