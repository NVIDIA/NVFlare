    "There are 2 main elements we haven't yet seen that we can use to execute workflows: `Task`s and data-exchange primitives (`Shareable`s and `DXO`s).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [`Task`](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.apis.controller_spec.html#nvflare.apis.controller_spec.Task) represents a unit of work assigned by the controller to the executors. It includes:\n",
    "    - `name`: The name of the task.\n",
    "    - `data`: The actual data or instructions associated with the task provided as a `Shareable`.\n",
    "    - Additional properties or metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How is it used?: The Controller creates tasks and sends them to the clients (we'll dive into how in a bit). Executors receive these tasks and process them in the execute method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Shareable` and [`DXO`](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.apis.dxo.html) (Data Exchange Object) are two key data structures used for data-exchange between parties in NVFlare. They serve different purposes but are designed to interact closely with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A `Shareable` is a flexible data container used for transmitting data between different components in NVFlare. It's essentially a Python dictionary (dict) that can hold any serializable data. It can contain both data and metadata and is used as the primary medium for sending and receiving messages over the network. As said, values must be serializable to ensure they can be transmitted between processes or over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A `DXO` provides a standardized way to represent and handle common types of data exchanged during federated learning, such as model weights, gradients, metrics, and hyperparameters. It encapsulates the actual data along with metadata about the data and defines the kind of data being exchanged using `DataKind`. `DXO`s help in maintaining consistency and understanding of data across different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Shareable`s and `DXO`s can be easily converted into each other by using the `to_shareable()` and `from_shareable()` methods. We usually use a `DXO` to to package the data and metadata, and then convert it to a `Shareable` to send it over the network. On the receiving end, we convert the `Shareable` back to a `DXO` to access the data and metadata directly."
