    "# Building custom components\n",
    "\n",
    "In NVFlare, the [`FLComponent`](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.apis.fl_component.html#nvflare.apis.fl_component.FLComponent) is the base class of all components, including controllers, executors, responders, filters, aggregators and many others (see the [here](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/fl_component.html) for more details). `FLComponent`s have the capability to handle and fire events and contain various methods for logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to implement a very basic custom `Controller` and `Executor` in NVFlare:\n",
    "- a [`Controller`](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.apis.impl.controller.html) is a server-side component responsible for managing job execution and orchestrating tasks across clients\n",
    "- an [`Executor`](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.apis.executor.html) is a client-side component that processes tasks received from the controller and executes them accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first tutorial we won't go into the details of tasks and execution. Instead, we'll start by creating placeholder versions of these components and then add some very basic functionality to them to better understand the flow of execution and the roles of the different components involved."

    "## The Controller\n",
    "We'll start by creating a `PlaceholderController` class that doesn't perform any specific tasks but serves as a template for understanding how controllers work in NVFlare.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a subclass of `Controller`, our `PlaceholderController` must implement three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `control_flow`: defining the main control flow of the controller. It receives an `abort_signal: Signal` and an `fl_ctx: FLContext`. A [`Signal`](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.apis.signal.html#nvflare.apis.signal.Signal) is an object that provides a mechanism to signal events like abortion. Controllers and executors can check this signal to determine if they should stop execution gracefully. More details on handling abort signals [here](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/best_practices.html#respect-the-abort-signal). An [`FLContext`](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.apis.fl_context.html#nvflare.apis.fl_context.FLContext) object carries all the execution context, which includes information about the current execution environment, such as run number, job ID, and other configurations. It's passed to many methods to provide context. More details can be found [here](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/programming_guide/fl_context.html). We'll talk more about it in the next notebooks.\n",
    "- `start_controller`: called once before the `control_flow` method. It's used to perform any setup tasks or initialize resources.\n",
    "- `stop_controller`: called once after the `control_flow` method. It's used to clean up resources or perform any finalization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
