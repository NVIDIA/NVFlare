    "[Cyclic Weight Transfer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29617797) (CWT) uses the server-controlled `CyclicController` to pass the model weights from one site to the next in a cyclic fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Cyclic workflow, sites train one at a time, while sending the model to the next site. The order of the sites can be specified as fixed, random, or random (without same in a row).  A round is finished once all sites in the defined order have completed training once, and the final result is returned to the server. This differs from Scatter-and-Gather or FedAvg workflows, wherein all sites train simultaneously and aggregate their results together at the end of a round.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrated two implementations of Cyclic Weight Transfer (CWT) using NVFlare:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Server-Controlled CWT Workflow**:\n",
    "- Uses the `CyclicController` on the server side\n",
    "- Server manages the training order and model distribution\n",
    "- Sites train sequentially, passing model weights to the next site\n",
    "- Server receives and persists the final model after each round\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Client-Controlled CWT Workflow**:\n",
    "- Uses `CyclicServerController` and `CyclicClientController`\n",
    "- Implements peer-to-peer communication for enhanced privacy\n",
    "- Server only manages job lifecycle and configuration\n",
    "- Clients handle model transfer and training coordination\n",
    "- Supports encrypted model transfer between clients\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "- Both workflows maintain the same algorithmic approach to CWT\n",
    "- Support for fixed, random, or random-without-repetition site ordering\n",
    "- Integration with PyTorch models and training scripts\n",
    "- Built-in support for model persistence and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two approaches is the level of server involvement in the training process, with the client-controlled version providing enhanced privacy through peer-to-peer communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will have a look at a [swarm learning](../07.2.3_swarm_learning/swarm_learning.ipynb) example, which also covers client-controlled cross-site evaluation workflows."
