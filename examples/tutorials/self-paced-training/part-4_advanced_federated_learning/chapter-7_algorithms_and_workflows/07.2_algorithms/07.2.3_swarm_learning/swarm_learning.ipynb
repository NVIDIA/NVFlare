    "# Swarm Learning with Cross-Site Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will demonstrate the [Swarm Learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03583-3) and **Client-Controlled Cross-Site Evaluation** Workflows using the Client API and the CIFAR10 dataset. \n",
    "Unlike traditional federated learning, which relies on a central server to aggregate model updates, Swarm Learning eliminates the need for a central aggregator. Each participating node trains the model locally and shares only the learned parameters (e.g., weights) with other nodes, which act directly as aggregators.\n",

    "\n",
    "Swarm Learning is a decentralized Federated Averaging algorithm where the key difference is that the server is not trusted with any sensitive information. The server is now only responsible for job health and lifecycle management via the `SwarmServerController`, while the clients are now responsible for training and aggregation logic via the swarm client-controlled `SwarmClientController`.\n",
    "Similarly to the `Client-Controlled Cyclic Workflow` described in the previous [chapter](../07.2.2_cyclic/cyclic_weight_transfer_example.ipynb), the server is not involved in the communication of weight updates — instead a **peer-to-peer** communication channel is used for implementing swarm learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SwarmServerController`: manages swarm job lifecycle and configurations such as `aggr_clients` and `train_clients`\n",
    "- `SwarmClientController`: sends `learn_task`  to all training clients to invoke their executors for `train` task each round, and sends results to designated `aggr_client` for aggregation.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored two key concepts in advanced federated learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Swarm Learning**:\n",
    "- A decentralized approach to federated learning that eliminates the need for a central server\n",
    "- Uses `SwarmServerController` for job lifecycle management\n",
    "- Employs `SwarmClientController` for training and aggregation logic\n",
    "- Clients directly share parameters with each other instead of going through a central server\n",
    "2. **Client-Controlled Cross-Site Evaluation**:\n",
    "- Enables direct client-to-client model sharing for validation\n",
    "- Uses `CrossSiteEvalServerController` for workflow management\n",
    "- Implements `CrossSiteEvalClientController` for evaluation coordination\n",
    "- Supports tasks like \"validate\" and \"submit_model\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides enhanced privacy and security by keeping sensitive data on client devices while enabling effective model training and evaluation across multiple sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll learn about [Split Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06060), another alternative to standard federated learning, suitable for vertical data partitioning among sites. To enable, real-world split learning, we start with a privacy-preserving way to find common case ids between datasets from different sites, namely [Private Set Intersection](../07.2.4_split_learning/federated_private_set_intersection.ipynb)."
