    "1. Convolutional layers\n",
    "2. Fully connected layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional layers are only optimized on the client holding the images, while the fully connected layers are optimized on the client holding the labels. For details see the [SplitNN](./src/splitnn/split_nn.py) code.\n",

    "class SplitNN(ModerateCNN):\n",

    "### Peer-to-peer Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable direct **peer-to-peer** communication between the clients, we will utilize NVFlare's low-level communication API. The [CIFAR10LearnerSplitNN](./src/splitnn/cifar10_learner_splitnn.py) class handles the execution of the forward & backward pass depending `split_id` specified by the client ID (see the Job API configuration below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to proceed the with the split learning, the client holding the images (\"site-1\") needs to send activations to the client holding the corresponding labels (\"site-2\"). We can use [Aux channel](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.private.aux_runner.html#nvflare.private.aux_runner.AuxRunner.send_aux_request), i.e., `engine.send_aux_request()`, to directly pass that information between the clients, i.e., implement a peer-to-peer communication channel. The result of the request will include the gradients computed in the backward pass from \"site-2\" which will allow \"site-1\" one to continue the optimization of ther part of the SplitNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            # send to other side\n",
