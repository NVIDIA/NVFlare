    "\n",
    "In this example, we further extend the existing histogram-based horizontal and vertical federated learning approaches to support secure federated learning using homomorphic encryption. Depending on the characteristics of the data to be encrypted, we can choose between [CKKS](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL) and [Paillier](https://github.com/intel/pailliercryptolib_python).\n",

This is because under horizontal FL, the local histogram quantiles are based on the local data distribution, which may not be the same as the global distribution.\n",
