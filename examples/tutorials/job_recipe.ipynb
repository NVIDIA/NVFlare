    "\n",
    "The NVFlare [Quickstart Guide](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/quickstart.html#installation) provides instructions for setting up FLARE on a local system or in a Docker image. We've also cloned the NVFlare GitHub in our top-level working directory."

    "## Motivation for Using JobRecipe\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Job API** provides a powerful and flexible way to define FLARE FL workflow and configurations in python without manually edit configuration files. While the API made it simple compare to previous process, but it is not simple enough. For new users and / or data scientists working with standard pipeline, such learning curve is unnecessary in understanding detailed concepts such as controllers, executors, workflows, and how to wire them together. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, NVFlare introduces the concept of **Job Recipes**. A `JobRecipe` is a simplified abstraction designed to provide a high-level API with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Only the key arguments** a data scientist should care about, such as number of clients, number of rounds, training scripts, and model definition.\n",
    "* **Provide consistent entry points** for common federated learning patterns such as **FedAvg** and **Cyclic Training**.\n",
    "* **Provide execution environments** from simulation to production for a same job. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes `JobRecipe` particularly useful as a **first touchpoint** for new users and data scientists working with standard pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of learning the entire Job API, users can start with a recipe and focus only on high-level parameters (e.g., `min_clients`, `num_rounds`, etc).\n",
    "* Recipes encapsulate the necessary job structure and execution logic, ensuring correctness while reducing the chance of misconfiguration.\n",
    "* If necessary, users can later progress to customizing the full Job API once they are comfortable with the basics."
