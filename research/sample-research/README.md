# Sample Research Project

## Objective
Describe the main objective intended with this design, to give an overview to the reader. This should be less than 3 sentences so that the reader can quickly grasp why this is important.

**The sample research project is used illustrate the structure and requirements need for research project**

### Goals:

List the goals that this design and its implementation intends to address.
Goals are more specific than the objective, listing specific deliverables.

**The goal of this project to illustrate the format and structure**

### Non-goals:

List items that people might think are part of the goal of this doc at a first glance, but it isn't.
The idea is to clarify to readers what is not intended in this project

**it is not intend to provide the actual runnable code scripts in this sample project**

## Background
Provide an overview of the current state, how things are currently done and what are the pain points that will be tackled. This section should provide enough information so that unfamiliar readers can understand the context behind this effort.

**Context/Intro/background goes here**

## Description
Every design and implementation has some assumptions behind it, either about the state of the world and what will be needed. State the main ones clearly here and evaluate the associated risks with that assumption being false.

## Setup

Install required packages for training
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
Add any other requirements, e.g., setting the `PYTHONPATH`.

## Steps to run the code 

Data download and preparation (if applicable).

## Expected Results
Description of the expected results, and optional figures/tables.

## Requirements
Each research project should contain a `requirements.txt` file containing all dependencies, including the required NVFLARE version.
