Research Tools
</h2> <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-slate-600 m-auto">
NVIDIA FLARE is an excellent research tool, offering robust simulation capabilities and extensive support for experimentation in federated learning.
              Many researchers need to simulate federated learning scenarios without setting up an actual federated learning system.
              NVIDIA FLARE allows for repeated experimentation with different parameters, facilitating quick evaluations and monitoring of results.

NVIDIA FLARE Simulation Tools

              The Simulator is a multi-threaded/process simulation tool that offers both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Python API.
              It enables the simulation of different numbers of clients and the execution of various federated learning jobs.
              Once a simulation is complete, users can deploy the same code in production without any changes.
              Additionally, users can utilize an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) debugger to step through the code for easier debugging.

              POC mode simulates real-world deployment on a local host.
              Clients and servers can be deployed in different directories and launched using separate terminals, each representing a different client or server startup.
              This mode allows for job submissions to the server as would occur in a real production environment.

Here are five real life implementations in healthcare, pushing the envelope for training robust, generalizable AI models:

Therefore the goal of this study was to train a previously developed AI model that determines whether a person with COVID-19 symptoms will need supplemental oxygen hours or even days after an initial exam. The approach included a separate server hosted on AWS, which held the global deep neural network. Each client-site received a copy of the model to train on its own dataset and FLARE was used to aggregate to form a global model. <br><br> Training was completed in two weeks and produced a global model with .94 Area Under the Curve (AUC), resulting in excellent prediction for the level of oxygen required by incoming patients. <br><br> <a class="text-nvidia" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01506-3">Federated learning for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19</a>  </div><div class="mt-20"> <h3 class="mt-3 text-2xl font-semibold leading-6 text-gray-900 group-hover:text-gray-600"> ADOPS (ACR DASA OSU Partners HealthCare Stanford) </h3> <p class="mt-5 text-lg leading-6 text-slate-600"> Breast Mammography AI Model.

The team used a 2D mammography classification model provided by PHS, which was trained using NVIDIA Clara Train on NVIDIA GPUs. The model was then retrained using NVIDIA Clara Federated Learning at PHS, as well as the client-sites, without any data being transferred. <br><br> Each institution obtained a better performing model that had an overall superior predictive power on their own local dataset. In doing so, Federated Learning enabled improved breast density classification from mammograms, which could lead to better breast cancer risk assessment. <br><br> <a class="text-nvidia" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01871.pdf">Federated Learning for Breast Density Classification: A Real-World Implementation</a>  </div><div class="mt-20"> <h3 class="mt-3 text-2xl font-semibold leading-6 text-gray-900 group-hover:text-gray-600"> University of Minnesota and Fairview X-Ray COVID AI Model </h3> <p class="mt-5 text-lg leading-6 text-slate-600"> Improve AI models for COVID-19 diagnosis based on chest X-rays <br> University of Minnesota and Fairview Mhealth, Indiana University (Indiana, USA), and Emory University (Georgia, USA) <br> </p><div class="flex justify-left"> <img class="mt-6 items-center w-2/3 mb-6" src="" alt=""> </div> The goal of this study was to improve real-world AI models for COVID-19 diagnosis based on chest X-rays.
