## Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with NeMo

In this example, we utilize NeMo's [supervised fine-tuning](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher#515-instruction-following-via-supervised-finetuning--sft-)
feature to showcase how to fine-tune the whole model on supervised data for learning how to follow user-specified instructions. 

Due to the large model size of the LLM, we use NVFlare's streaming feature to transfer the model in chunks.

## Hardware requirement
The example for a 3-client 1.3B GPT model experiment can be performed on either three 32 GB V100 GPUs, or one 80 GB A100 GPU.

## Dependencies
This example of running a 1.3B GPT model requires considerable computational resources. For training 1.3B model, SFT needs ~24GB GPU memory using fp16 precision. Hence, we can compute the resources needed accordingly to run three clients in parallel.

The example was tested using the [NeMo Docker container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo), 
available with `docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:23.06`. 
In the following, we assume this example folder of the container is mounted to `/workspace` and all downloading, etc. operations are based on this root path.

Start the docker container using 
```
DOCKER_IMAGE="nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:23.06"
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm --shm-size=16g -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
-v ${PWD}:/workspace -w /workspace ${DOCKER_IMAGE}
```

For easy experimentation with NeMo, install NVFlare and mount the code inside the [nemo_nvflare](./nemo_nvflare) folder.
```
pip install nvflare~=2.4.0rc7
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/workspace
``` 

To download the pre-trained model, we use [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com).
Install it in the container with
```
apt update
apt install git-lfs
```

## Download the pre-trained LLM
In this example, we use [Megatron-GPT 1.3B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemo-megatron-gpt-1.3B), a transformer-based language model based on the GPT architecture.
We download the model from HuggingFace using git lfs
```
mkdir Models
cd Models
git clone https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemo-megatron-gpt-1.3B
cd ..
```

## Data preprocessing
For SFT task, we will use three datasets:
- [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca) 
- [databricks-dolly-15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k)
- [OpenAssistant Conversations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1)

These three datasets contain instruction-following data in different formats under different settings: oasst1 features a tree structure for full conversations, while the other two are instruction(w/ or w/o context)-response pairs.

In this example, we first preprocess them following the [NeMo SFT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher#5151-sft-data-formatting) instructions. The script converts the "Instruction", "Context" and "Response" fields (or their equivalents) into "Input" and "Output". The script also concatenates the "Instruction" and "Context" fields with a \n\n separator and randomizes the order in which they appear in the input to generate a new JSONL file.

#### 1. Download the datasets
We download the datasets from HuggingFace:
```
mkdir Data
cd Data
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1
cd ..
```

#### 2. Preprocess each dataset
We preprocess each dataset using the following script:
``` 
mkdir Data/Processed
mkdir Data/Processed/alpaca
python utils/preprocess_alpaca.py --training_file Data/alpaca/data/train-00000-of-00001-a09b74b3ef9c3b56.parquet --output_dir Data/Processed/alpaca
mkdir Data/Processed/dolly
python utils/preprocess_dolly.py --training_file Data/databricks-dolly-15k/databricks-dolly-15k.jsonl --output_dir Data/Processed/dolly
mkdir Data/Processed/oasst1
python utils/preprocess_oasst1.py --training_file Data/oasst1/data/train-00000-of-00001-b42a775f407cee45.parquet --validation_file Data/oasst1/data/validation-00000-of-00001-134b8fd0c89408b6.parquet --output_dir Data/Processed/oasst1
```

#### 3. Combine for centralized training
We also generate a combined version for a centralized training baseline:
```
mkdir Data/Processed/combined
python utils/combine_jsonl.py --file_list Data/Processed/alpaca/training.jsonl Data/Processed/dolly/training.jsonl Data/Processed/oasst1/training.jsonl --output_path Data/Processed/combined/training.jsonl
python utils/combine_jsonl.py --file_list Data/Processed/alpaca/validation.jsonl Data/Processed/dolly/validation.jsonl Data/Processed/oasst1/validation.jsonl --output_path Data/Processed/combined/validation.jsonl
python utils/combine_jsonl.py --file_list Data/Processed/alpaca/testing.jsonl Data/Processed/dolly/testing.jsonl Data/Processed/oasst1/testing.jsonl --output_path Data/Processed/combined/testing.jsonl
```

## Federated learning simulations
We can either use NVFlare's [FL Simulator](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/getting_started.html#the-fl-simulator) or [POC mode](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/getting_started.html#setting-up-poc) to simulate federated learning experiments.

First, we create the configuration files and modify them to include the current directory path to access the dataset and pre-trained LLM.
At this point, we also modify the data path and local number of clients.

We perform 5 experiments in total: training on each client's own dataset, on combined dataset, and all three clients training together using the 
[FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) algorithm implemented in NVFlare.

### Job configurations 
For single-site trainings, in a standard terminal, run
```
python utils/create_configs.py --job_folder "jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_alpaca" --num_clients 1 --devices 1 --train_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/alpaca/training.jsonl --validation_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/combined/validation.jsonl
python utils/create_configs.py --job_folder "jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_dolly" --num_clients 1 --devices 1 --train_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/dolly/training.jsonl --validation_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/combined/validation.jsonl
python utils/create_configs.py --job_folder "jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_oasst1" --num_clients 1 --devices 1 --train_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/oasst1/training.jsonl --validation_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/combined/validation.jsonl
python utils/create_configs.py --job_folder "jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_combined" --num_clients 1 --devices 1 --train_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/combined/training.jsonl --validation_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/combined/validation.jsonl
```
and for FedAvg:
```
python utils/create_configs.py --job_folder "jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_fedavg" --num_clients 3 --devices 1 --train_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/alpaca/training.jsonl /workspace/Data/Processed/dolly/training.jsonl /workspace/Data/Processed/oasst1/training.jsonl --validation_ds_files /workspace/Data/Processed/combined/validation.jsonl  /workspace/Data/Processed/combined/validation.jsonl  /workspace/Data/Processed/combined/validation.jsonl
```
Here, each client performs SFT for one local epoch before sending their local model updates to the server for aggregation. 

Note that we used the combined validation set for all experiments, allowing for a direct comparison across all training settings.

### Use FL Simulator
We use the NVFlare simulator to run the FL training experiments, using the following commands:
For local training on each dataset separately and on the combined dataset:
```
nvflare simulator jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_alpaca -w workspace_simulator_alpaca -n 1 -gpu 0
nvflare simulator jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_dolly -w workspace_simulator_dolly -n 1 -gpu 0
nvflare simulator jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_oasst1 -w workspace_simulator_oasst1 -n 1 -gpu 0
nvflare simulator jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_combined -w workspace_simulator_combined -n 1 -gpu 0
```
For FedAvg:
```
nvflare simulator jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_fedavg -w workspace_simulator_fedavg -n 3 -gpu 0,0,0
```

### Use POC mode
Alternatively, we can also use NVFlare's [POC mode](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/getting_started.html#setting-up-poc) to simulate 

#### 1. Local and Centralized SFT
For single-site and centralized training experiments, we create the poc workspaces:
```
nvflare poc prepare -n 1
```
For 1.3B model experiment, we start the NVFlare system with one GPU:
```
nvflare poc start --gpu 0
```
For better usability, open a new terminal and start the [admin command prompt](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/real_world_fl/operation.html#admin-command-prompt):
```
nvflare poc start -p admin@nvidia.com
```


Next, copy the jobs to the temp workspace.
```
cp -r jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_* /tmp/nvflare/poc/example_project/prod_00/admin\@nvidia.com/transfer/
```

To submit the single-client SFT jobs for each experiment:
```
submit_job gpt_sft_1.3B_alpaca
submit_job gpt_sft_1.3B_dolly
submit_job gpt_sft_1.3B_oasst1
submit_job gpt_sft_1.3B_combined
```
During training, we can visualize the training process using TensorBoard.
With FL simulator, use
```
tensorboard --logdir /workspace
```

#### 2. Federated SFT
We use the [FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) algorithm to perform SFT on the model in a federated scenario with 3 clients, each uses one of the three datasets. 

We create the poc workspaces:
```
nvflare poc prepare -n 3
```
For 1.3B model experiment, each client needs ~24 GB memory, here we start the NVFlare system with one 80GB A100 GPU :
```
nvflare poc start --gpu 0
```
For better usability, open a new terminal and start the [admin command prompt](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/real_world_fl/operation.html#admin-command-prompt):
```
nvflare poc start -p admin@nvidia.com
```


Next, simulate the federated SFT using FedAvg, similarly to single-client experiments:
```
cp -r jobs/gpt_sft_1.3B_fedavg /tmp/nvflare/poc/example_project/prod_00/admin\@nvidia.com/transfer/
```
and to submit the FedAvg job
```
submit_job gpt_sft_1.3B_fedavg
```

During training, we can visualize the training process using TensorBoard.
With the POC mode, use
```
tensorboard --logdir /tmp/nvflare/poc
```

## Results

In this scenario, all experiments utilize the same validation set, allowing for a direct comparison across all models. Note that we ran FL for 5 rounds, and asked NeMo to record the validation losses every few steps during local training.

The validation losses for all experiments are shown below.
![Validation losses](images/val_loss.png)
The curves shown are:
- yellow: oasst1 
- green: dolly
- blue: alpaca
- magenta: three datasets combined

The light curves are for single site training, and the dark curves are for FedAvg

As shown, the global model from FedAvg is able to generate a loss comparable to that of training with all three datasets combined.

Loss curve is one indication of model performance, but we also want to see if the model is able to generate reasonable text. Hence, we benchmarked the trained models with standard language modeling tasks under zero-shot setting, including [HellaSwag](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07830.pdf)(H), [PIQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11641.pdf)(P), and [WinoGrande](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10641.pdf)(W). 
Below is the accuracy of the models on these tasks.

|              | H_acc | H_acc_norm | P_acc | P_acc_norm | W_acc | Mean  |
|:------------:|:-----:|:----------:|:-----:|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|  BaseModel   | 0.357 |   0.439    | 0.683 |   0.689    | 0.537 | 0.541 |
|    Alpaca    | 0.372 |   0.451    | 0.675 |   0.687    | 0.550 | 0.547 |
|    Dolly     | 0.376 |   0.474    | 0.671 |   0.667    | 0.529 | 0.543 |
|    Oasst1    | 0.370 |   0.452    | 0.657 |   0.655    | 0.506 | 0.528 |
|   Combined   | 0.370 |   0.453    | 0.685 |   0.690    | 0.548 | 0.549 |
|    FedAvg    | 0.377 |   0.469    | 0.688 |   0.687    | 0.560 | 0.556 |

As shown, FedAvg is able to generate a model with the best overall performance.    

## Inference
We use NeMo's [inference script](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/nlp/language_modeling/megatron_gpt_eval.py) for generation task with models after SFT. 
Below, we define some test examples to feed to the SFT model to see its predictions.

First, we ask the model to generate an answer to an open question: "Tell me an interesting fact about space travel." 
```
ALPACA: The first human to orbit the Earth was Neil Armstrong, who flew on the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.'
DOLLY: The International Space Station is the largest floating structure in the universe. It is made of steel and is about the size of a small house.
OASST: Sure! Here are a few interesting facts about space travel:\n\n1. Space travel is possible even with small amounts of fuel. The amount of
COMBINED: The first human to set foot on the Moon was Neil Armstrong.
FEDAVG: The first person to travel to space was Neil Armstrong, who set foot on the moon in 1969.
```
Note that models mostly give plausible answers, but the ALPACA-finetuned model, in fact, gives misinformation since it should be Yuri Gagarin who is the first human to orbit the Earth.
On the other hand, the model trained on the combined dataset, as well as the FL model trained with FedAvg, are able to generate a more accurate answer.

Next, we ask the model to answer a question according to a given context, one instance from [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/).

Context being "Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi\'s Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.", 

Input being "Which NFL team represented the AFC at Super Bowl 50?" 

By using a simple prompt `***CONTEXT*** + context + ***INPUT*** + question + ***OUTPUT***`, we have the following results:
```
ALPACA: The AFC champion Denver Broncos represented the AFC at Super Bowl 50.'
DOLLY: The NFL team that represented the AFC at Super Bowl 50 was the Denver Broncos.'
OASST: The Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win the Super Bowl 50 championship.'
COMBINED: The Denver Broncos'
FEDAVG: The AFC champion Denver Broncos defeated the NFC champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to win the Super Bowl.'
```
As we can see, the keyword "Denver Broncos" is correctly captured by all models. However, ALPACA and FedAvg answers are a bit redundant, and OASST answer is not directly "to the question".

Based on the above results, we can see that the models trained on the combined dataset and in a federated fashion can generate more stable and accurate answers.
