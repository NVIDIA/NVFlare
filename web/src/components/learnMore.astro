      "Federated Learning is a distributed learning paradigm where training occurs across multiple clients, each with their own local datasets. This enables the creation of common robust models without sharing sensitive local data, helping solve issues of data privacy and security.",

    title: "FLARE Design and Features",
    description:
      "At its core, FLARE serves as a federated computing framework, with applications such as Federated Learning and Federated Analytics built upon this foundation. Notably, it is agnostic to datasets, workloads, and domains. In contrast to centralized data lake solutions that necessitate copying data to a central location, FLARE brings computing capabilities directly to distributed datasets",
