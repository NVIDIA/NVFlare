        in-process `launch_external_process=False` uses InProcessClientAPIExecutor (default).
        ex-process `launch_external_process=True` uses ClientAPILauncherExecutor.

        Args:
            script (str): Script to run. For in-process must be a python script path. For ex-process can be any script support by `command`.
            script_args (str): Optional arguments for script (appended to script).
            launch_external_process (bool): Whether to launch the script in external process. Defaults to False.
            command (str): If launch_external_process=True, command to run script (preprended to script). Defaults to "python3".
            framework (str): Framework type to connfigure converter and params exchange formats. Defaults to FrameworkType.PYTORCH.
            params_transfer_type (str): How to transfer the parameters. FULL means the whole model parameters are sent.
                DIFF means that only the difference is sent. Defaults to TransferType.FULL.
