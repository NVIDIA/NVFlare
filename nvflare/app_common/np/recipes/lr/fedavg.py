class FedAvgLrRecipe(Recipe):
    """A recipe for implementing Federated Averaging (FedAvg) for Logistics Regression with Newton Raphson.
    FedAvg is a fundamental federated learning algorithm that aggregates model updates
    from multiple clients by computing a weighted average based on the amount of local
    training data. This recipe sets up a complete federated learning workflow with
    scatter-and-gather communication pattern.

    The recipe configures:
    - A federated job with initial model (optional)
    - Weighted aggregator for combining client model updates (or custom aggregator)
    - Script runners for client-side training execution

    Args:
        name: Name of the federated learning job. Defaults to "lr_fedavg".
        num_rounds: Number of federated training rounds to execute. Defaults to 2.
        damping_factor: default to 0.8
        train_script: Path to the training script that will be executed on each client.
        train_args: Command line arguments to pass to the training script.
        launch_external_process (bool): Whether to launch the script in external process. Defaults to False.
        command (str): If launch_external_process=True, command to run script (prepended to script). Defaults to "python3".

    Example:
        ```python
            recipe = FedAvgLrRecipe(num_rounds=num_rounds,
                            damping_factor=0.8,
