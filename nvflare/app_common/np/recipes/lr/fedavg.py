class FedAvgLrRecipe(Recipe):
    """A recipe for implementing Federated Averaging (FedAvg) for Logistics Regression with Newton Raphson.
    FedAvg is a fundamental federated learning algorithm that aggregates model updates
    from multiple clients by computing a weighted average based on the amount of local
    training data. This recipe sets up a complete federated learning workflow with
    scatter-and-gather communication pattern.

    The recipe configures:
    - A federated job with initial model (optional)
    - Weighted aggregator for combining client model updates (or custom aggregator)
    - Script runners for client-side training execution

    Args:
        name: Name of the federated learning job. Defaults to "lr_fedavg".
        initial_model: Initial model to start federated training with. If None,
            clients will start with their own local models.
        clients: List of selected client names to participate in training. If None,
            all available clients will be used.
        num_clients: Number of sampled clients expected to participate. If clients is provided,
            this will be set automatically to len(clients).
        min_clients: Minimum number of clients required to start a training round.
            Defaults to 0 (no minimum).
        num_rounds: Number of federated training rounds to execute. Defaults to 2.
        damping_factor: default to 0.8
        train_script: Path to the training script that will be executed on each client.
        train_args: Command line arguments to pass to the training script.
        launch_external_process (bool): Whether to launch the script in external process. Defaults to False.
        command (str): If launch_external_process=True, command to run script (prepended to script). Defaults to "python3".

    Example:
        ```python
        recipe = FedAvgLrRecipe(
            name="lr_fedavg",
            initial_model=pretrained_model,
