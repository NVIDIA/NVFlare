# ExecuTorch Libraries

This directory should contain the ExecuTorch Android libraries (.aar files) that are required for the NVFlare Android app.

## Required Libraries

Based on the CIFAR-10 ExecuTorch example, you need to add the following libraries:

1. **executorch.aar** - Main ExecuTorch library
2. **executorch_training.aar** - ExecuTorch training library (if separate)

## How to Obtain

1. **From ExecuTorch Release**: Download the latest ExecuTorch Android libraries from the official releases
2. **From CIFAR-10 Example**: Copy the libraries from the working CIFAR-10 example project
3. **Build from Source**: Build ExecuTorch from source and extract the Android libraries

## Installation Steps

1. Download the required .aar files
2. Place them in this `libs/` directory
3. The build.gradle.kts is already configured to include all .aar files from this directory

## Note

The build.gradle.kts file uses:
```kotlin
implementation(fileTree(mapOf("dir" to "libs", "include" to listOf("*.jar", "*.aar"))))
```

This will automatically include all .jar and .aar files in this directory.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Libraries not yet added** - You need to add the ExecuTorch libraries before the app will compile and run successfully.

# Clone ExecuTorch repository
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git --recurse-submodules
cd executorch

# Setup Python environment (optional but recommended)
uv venv --seed --prompt et --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install build tools and ExecuTorch pip wheel
./install_executorch.sh

# Build ExecuTorch for Android
./scripts/build_android_library.sh

# Create libs directory in NVFlare Android app
mkdir -p nvflare/edge/device/android/app/libs

# Copy the ExecuTorch AAR - make sure the app directory is what you are actually using
cp ./extension/android/executorch_android/build/outputs/aar/executorch_android-debug.aar nvflare/edge/device/android/app/libs/executorch.aar

Copy nvflare/edge/ios/NVFlareMobile/NVFlareMobile/Assets.xcassets/cifar10/data_batch_1.dataset/data_batch_1.bin to nvflare/edge/device/android/app/src/main/assets/data_batch_1.bin

## ⚠️ Important: SDK Copy Requirement

**Critical Setup Step**: The NVFlare Android SDK contents must be copied to the app's source directory for the app to build and function correctly.

### SDK Source Location
The SDK source code is located at: `nvflare/edge/device/android/sdk/`

This directory contains:
- `core/` - Core SDK functionality
- `training/` - Training-related components  
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `models/` - Model definitions
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `ETTrainerExecutor.kt` - Main training executor

### Required Action: Copy SDK to App
**You must copy the contents of the SDK directory to the app's source directory:**

```bash
# Copy the SDK directory to the proper package structure
cp -r nvflare/edge/device/android/sdk nvflare/edge/device/android/app/src/main/java/com/nvidia/nvflare
```

### Why This Is Required
The app code in `nvflare/edge/device/android/app/src/main/java/` does not contain the SDK code. The SDK is maintained separately in the `sdk/` directory, but its contents must be copied to the app's source directory during the build process.

### What Happens If SDK Is Not Copied
If the SDK contents are not copied to the app's source directory:
- The app will fail to compile with missing class errors
- Runtime errors will occur when trying to access SDK functionality
- Training operations will fail with `TrainingError.DATASET_CREATION_FAILED` or similar errors

### Verification
To ensure the SDK is properly set up:
1. Verify the `sdk/` directory exists at `nvflare/edge/device/android/sdk/`
2. Copy the SDK directory to `nvflare/edge/device/android/app/src/main/java/com/nvidia/nvflare`
3. Check that all required SDK files are now present at `nvflare/edge/device/android/app/src/main/java/com/nvidia/nvflare/sdk/`
4. Ensure the app can compile successfully
5. Test that the app can import and use SDK classes

**Note**: The SDK contents must be copied to the app's source directory before building. This is a manual step that must be performed when setting up the development environment.
