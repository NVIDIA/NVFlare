        BuffDeviceManager is responsible for managing the selection of devices for model training.
        It maintains a list of available devices, tracks the current selection, and refills the selection as needed.
        The device_selection_size determines how many "concurrent" devices can be selected for the training session.
        The min_hole_to_fill determines how many empty slots should be created before refilling.
            - An empty slot is created when any device reports its update back.
            - To fill a slot, a new device is selected from the available device pool.
        The device_reuse flag indicates whether devices can be reused across different model versions, if False, we will always select new devices when filling holes.
        Args:
            device_selection_size (int): Number of devices to select for each model update round.
            min_hole_to_fill (int): Minimum number of empty slots in device selection before refilling. Defaults to 1 - once received an update, immediately sample a new device and send the current task to it.
            device_reuse (bool): Whether to allow reusing devices across different model versions. Defaults to True.
