# NVFLARE Convert Hugging Face

## Use When

Use when converting training code built around `transformers.Trainer`,
`Seq2SeqTrainer`, TRL `SFTTrainer`, or another Trainer subclass. Support
full-model and PEFT/LoRA fine-tuning, datasets/tokenizers, Trainer callbacks and
metrics, checkpoint continuity, and replicated `torch.distributed` training.

## Do Not Use When

Do not use for an `AutoModel` driven by a manual PyTorch loop without a
Hugging Face Trainer (route to `nvflare-convert-pytorch`), PyTorch Lightning
(route to `nvflare-convert-lightning`, including Lightning modules that contain
Transformers models), inference-only pipelines, model serving, failed jobs
(route to `nvflare-diagnose-job`), or federated statistics without training
(route to `nvflare-fed-stats`). Route a project with active Lightning and
Hugging Face Trainer entrypoints to `nvflare-orient` to select one training-loop
owner or separate jobs. Route unresolved Trainer ownership, such as a Trainer
factory without a bound owner call, to `nvflare-orient`; do not patch either Trainer.
Out of scope: DeepSpeed, FSDP, production/POC deployment, controller rewrites,
experiment search, and privacy-protection requests such as HE, encrypted
aggregation, differential privacy, or privacy filters; never substitute an
unprotected recipe or present a disclaimer as implementation.
If a request combines federated statistics and model-training conversion, treat it as two independent jobs and
workflows: do not merge or automatically chain them, do not route the combination to `nvflare-orient`, and ask which
workflow to run first before generating or running either job. Recommend `nvflare-fed-stats` first only when the
user's purpose is to understand data distribution; handle conversion later as a separate request.

## Workflow

1. Load `../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-common.md` and apply it for the
   whole conversion; this SKILL.md states only the framework-specific deltas.
   Load `../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-workflow.md` only for a non-standard
   case that needs its detailed rerun, data-location, authorization, or
   missing-semantics guidance.
2. Inspect before editing with `nvflare agent inspect <path> --format json`
   plus direct source reading. Load `references/huggingface-detection.md` during
   this phase. If inspect recommends `nvflare-orient` for unresolved Trainer
   ownership or active Lightning/Hugging Face owners, stop before editing.
   Extract the entrypoint, Trainer subclass, model constructor, tokenizer or
   processor, datasets and collator, Trainer arguments, `compute_metrics`,
   callbacks, checkpoint and PEFT settings, precision, local budget,
   distributed launcher, site/round counts, data location, and aggregation
   intent. Do not import or execute user training modules to discover them.
3. Apply the dependency-install ordering rule in `../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-common.md` before
   any Python command imports user, framework, NVFLARE, or declared dependency
   modules.
4. Select the recipe from FL intent. For explicit FedAvg, run `nvflare recipe
   show fedavg-pt --format json`, then immediately load
   `../nvflare-shared/references/pytorch-family-recipe-construction.md` and use
   the returned module, class, and parameters with the required construction
   and execution shape in `assets/job.py`. Import `FedAvgRecipe` from
   `nvflare.app_opt.pt.recipes.fedavg`, never from `nvflare.recipe`. Treat
   `class_path` as the public recipe key and `path` as its normalized exported
   representation; do not inspect Recipe source or signatures to reconcile
   them. Do not guess adjacent symbols or add per-site recipe config unless
   sites genuinely differ. Load
   `../nvflare-shared/references/pytorch-family-recipe-selection.md` only for
   ambiguous, evaluation-only, or non-FedAvg requests.
5. Convert with `references/huggingface-conversion.md` and adapt
   `assets/client_with_eval.py` rather than drafting a new round loop. Preserve
   model, tokenizer/processor, datasets, collator, Trainer arguments,
   callbacks, and metrics. Partition site data per the "Site Data Partitioning"
   rule in `../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-common.md`. Import the Client API as
   `import nvflare.client.hf as flare`, so `flare.init()`, `flare.patch()`, and
   `flare.is_running()` resolve to `nvflare.client.hf`. Keep
   `flare.patch(trainer)` simple with inferred `params_scope="auto"` and encode
   one per-round budget in
   Trainer arguments: requested steps use `max_steps`, requested epochs use
   `num_train_epochs`, and a silent prompt uses the reported default
   `max_steps=10` unless source-budget preservation was requested. Do not
   duplicate the budget in patch `local_steps`/`local_epochs`. When the client
   uses `HfArgumentParser`, construct it with `allow_abbrev=False`.
6. Adapt `assets/server_model.py` and `assets/job.py` instead of inventing
   server-model, packaging, export, or `SimEnv` wiring. Keep generated and
   packaged project-local modules in the same writable source directory. Never
   use `..` in `train_script`, `add_server_file()`, or `add_client_file()`; use
   an existing resolved absolute path when co-location is impossible. Keep the
   server and Trainer model factory and exchange keyspace identical, with
   explicit model config rather than a live model. Apply only options confirmed
   by the construction reference. Preserve the job asset's recipe-before-parser
   ordering, `ArgumentParser(allow_abbrev=False)`, and strict `parse_args()`; do
   not use `parse_known_args()`.
7. Only after generated files exist, load
   `../nvflare-shared/references/validation-evidence.md`, then
   `references/huggingface-validation.md`. Follow the shared compile,
   construction, export, package-inspection, simulation, and terminal-evidence
   ladder; apply only the standard Trainer checks from the HF reference. Stop
   at the first failed rung. Review and exercise the maintained assets directly;
   do not inspect NVFLARE implementation source, improvise Recipe API probes, or
   write one-off AST programs to re-prove them. Use
   `references/huggingface-state-and-distributed.md`
   only when inspection found PEFT, DDP, checkpoint/restore overrides,
   auxiliary trainable models, or another non-default patch setting.
8. Report the recipe, source facts, parameter scope, data partition, changed
   files, validation status, and exact artifact paths. When validation produces
   metrics, load `../nvflare-shared/references/metrics-and-artifact-reporting.md`
   before the final response and report each observed primary scalar with its
   metric name, numeric value, and artifact or bounded-log source.

## Requirements

- Must use `flare.patch(trainer)` as the sole model-exchange owner. `receive()`
  inside a patched loop may inspect task metadata only; it must not load a
  second copy of the global model.
- Must pass the distributed rank to `flare.init(rank=rank)`; Client API
  initialization order otherwise follows `../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-common.md`.
- Must preserve source evaluation. When per-round global-model evaluation is
  required, call `trainer.evaluate()` before `trainer.train()` on every rank.
  Do not invent `compute_metrics`, label mappings, averaging denominators, or
  metric direction.
- Must follow the Best-Model Metric policy in
  `../nvflare-shared/references/pytorch-family-recipe-construction.md`; the
  Hugging Face delta is only how the delivered key is named and produced. Must
  preserve source metric names when practical: if the generated
  `trainer.evaluate()` emits `accuracy`, set `key_metric="accuracy"`; if Trainer
  emits a prefixed key such as `eval_accuracy`, set the server to that exact key
  and report the source-to-server mapping. When best-model selection is
  requested, every lower-is-better metric, including Trainer-generated
  `eval_loss`, is delivered as an explicitly negated companion and selected by
  that key — never as raw loss. Otherwise leave `key_metric` unspecified and
  retain the recipe default; do not add a skill-specific sentinel or claim that
  the selector was disabled.
- Must preserve PEFT configuration exactly and verify adapter key compatibility
  between the server model and patched Trainer. Do not infer LoRA target
  modules, silently switch adapter/full-model scope, or solve key mismatches
  with non-strict loading.
- Must verify that `trainer.model` owns all federated trainable state for
  Trainer subclasses with reference, reward, value-head, or other auxiliary
  models. Ask or fail closed when `params_scope="auto"` would omit trainable
  state required by the algorithm.
- Must preserve model constructor values needed on both server and clients per
  `../nvflare-shared/references/pytorch-model-exchange.md` (State-Dict
  Compatibility). Ask one semantic question or fail closed when required values
  are not statically available.
- Must patch only one Trainer per Python process. Preserve a single Trainer
  lifecycle across rounds when `restore_state=True`.
- Must use a positive `TrainingArguments.max_steps` budget for a length-less
  iterable training dataset and let `flare.patch(trainer)` infer it.
- Must reject or report DeepSpeed, FSDP, `save_only_model=True` with
  `restore_state=True`, `load_best_model_at_end=True`, prebuilt
  optimizer/scheduler instances with `restore_state=False`, and checkpoint paths
  not visible to every distributed rank. Do not rewrite these settings silently.
  `launch_once` is a framework-neutral recipe parameter owned by
  `../nvflare-shared/references/pytorch-family-recipe-construction.md`; the
  Hugging Face delta is only that the product rejects explicit
  `launch_once=False` together with `restore_state=True`.
- Must initialize `torch.distributed` before patching when rank environment
  variables declare multiple ranks. All ranks must call patched Trainer methods
  in identical order.
- Must not set `trust_remote_code=True`, download model/data artifacts unless
  requested, or recover from an offline/cache-only miss by going online. Cache
  misses, offline errors, remote identifiers, and validation requests do not
  authorize online retries. This narrows the authorization rules in
  `../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-common.md`.
- Site partitioning, custom aggregation, the Source Of Truth Boundary, and user
  input/authorization follow `../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-common.md`.

Always read this converter SKILL.md together with
`../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-common.md`. Complete each workflow
phase before loading the next phase's reference. Do not preload validation,
state/DDP, broad workflow, dependency, or reporting references. The standard
FedAvg path loads, in order:
`../nvflare-shared/references/conversion-common.md`,
`references/huggingface-detection.md`,
`../nvflare-shared/references/pytorch-family-recipe-construction.md`,
`references/huggingface-conversion.md`,
`../nvflare-shared/references/pytorch-model-exchange.md`,
`../nvflare-shared/references/validation-evidence.md`, and
`references/huggingface-validation.md`. Load
`references/huggingface-state-and-distributed.md` and other shared references
only under the triggers above. Do not depend on repository examples.
