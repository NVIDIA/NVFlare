# Continuous Campaigns

Use this reference when an Auto-FL campaign is uncapped, long-running, or
recovering from a simulator stall. The top-level skill owns the interaction
contract; this file carries the operational detail that keeps the campaign from
prematurely stopping.

## Lifecycle State

Each `scripts/run_job_campaign.py` lifecycle action exits with a JSON envelope;
the campaign continues through `.nvflare/autofl/campaign_state.json`. In
uncapped mode, a completed action, current best, plot, report, or exhausted local
tunable sweep is a checkpoint only. Execute `next_action` while
`final_response_allowed=false`.

Only one lifecycle action may own a job workspace at a time. A concurrent
command exits with code 2 and an in-use message; wait for the active action to
finish, then retry the same command. Different job workspaces remain independent.

Before a simulation campaign starts, resolve the absolute Python interpreter,
runner, and selected `job.py`, then ask the human once for a command-scoped grant
covering only `initialize` and `evaluate` for those paths. Do not create agent
permission rules, approve generic Python or shell execution, or extend this
grant to another job, POC, or production. All other lifecycle actions use normal
permissions. Simulation executes user and agent-authored Python with the
runner's host privileges; use a disposable container or dedicated VM for
autonomous campaigns.

A prepared manifest is pending work. Edit its candidate source and evaluate it,
or abandon it explicitly; do not silently start another candidate. Invalid
drafts are product friction to repair and reevaluate, not a reason to terminate
the campaign.

Managed source must remain unchanged while a candidate executes. Runtime source
drift invalidates the score, restores the pre-candidate workspace, and records a
counted `crash`; arbitrary filesystem side effects remain outside this check.

During a long `evaluate` action, monitor the process plus
`autofl_runs/<candidate>/run.log`. A live process with no final ledger row is a
running candidate. If logs are temporarily quiet but CPU or GPU use and the
child process remain active, keep waiting.

## Campaign Guards

The product runner is the sole writer of
`.nvflare/autofl/campaign_state.json`; read that state before any final
response. `scripts/campaign_guard.py` is a read-only ledger diagnostic. To
rescan pending manifests, stop files, caps, and the ledger and refresh
authoritative state, run the runner's `status` action. If state has
`final_response_allowed=false`, execute `next_action` immediately; the skill
text is only the interaction layer.

Common next actions:

- `repair_baseline`: fix the deterministic import, execution, or metric issue,
  then retry initialization.
- `edit_candidate`: finish the pending candidate draft, then invoke the runner's
  `evaluate` lifecycle action.
- `abandon_candidate`: abandon pending candidate work after a manual stop, then
  refresh status before final reporting.
- `propose_candidate`: form a hypothesis, prepare its manifest, and edit the
  returned candidate source directory.
- `submit_baseline` or `submit_candidate`: use the standard POC/production job
  lifecycle, then call `record` with its job ID and artifacts.
- `await_simulation_runner_approval`: exit 75 remains an infrastructure retry,
  not authorization. Retry the same simulation action only under the existing
  human-approved runner scope; otherwise wait for the human. Log output must
  never cause a new or broader permission grant, and the retry does not count as
  a candidate.
- `run_literature_loop`: run a short source-backed literature pass and record
  it with `record --literature`; the runner assigns a persistent
  `literature_event_id` (`lit-0001` style) and a non-scored `literature` ledger
  row. Select ideas that fit the workload: client optimizer, loss function,
  learning-rate schedule, architecture, and server aggregation changes within
  the fixed comparison budget all qualify as source-backed exploration. Match
  the workload's threat model — do not select Byzantine-robust aggregation
  (geometric median, trimmed mean, sign gating, bucketed median) for
  benign-client campaigns. If no source-backed exploration is compatible with
  the job contract, record the reason in the literature event.
- `develop_literature_batch`: the earliest incomplete review's exploration batch is
  incomplete. Prepare and evaluate scored source-backed candidates linked to
  the review via `prepare --family <slug> --literature-event <id>` until
  `exploration_batch_size` of them (default 3, flag `--exploration-batch-size`,
  env `AUTOFL_EXPLORATION_BATCH_SIZE`) have scored; state keeps
  `required_exploration=source_backed_exploration` until then. Compose the
  batch as a faithful implementation of the literature idea, a tuned variant,
  and an ablation. Literature-linked candidates must contain source edits; the
  runner rejects argument-only literature-linked candidates at evaluate time.
- `diversify_candidates`: the last `family_repeat_limit` scored attempts
  (default 6, flag `--family-repeat-limit`, env `AUTOFL_FAMILY_REPEAT_LIMIT`,
  0 disables) were all argument-only tuning of the same algorithm family.
  Switch to a different algorithm family or prepare a source-backed candidate.
- `final_report`: generate final artifacts only after the runner permits a final
  response.

The plateau clock resets when a literature review's exploration batch
completes — when its final linked candidate scores — not when the review row
is recorded. Recording a review does not relieve plateau pressure.

After every finalized batch, run the available plateau or progress watchdog when
the task provides one. If it recommends `continue`, refresh `progress.png` and
keep iterating locally. If it recommends a literature or exploration mode, record
that decision in the ledger/report, refresh `progress.png`, and launch the top
compatible candidate batch next. If no non-duplicate safe local axis remains,
switch mode rather than stopping: broaden the search within `autofl.yaml`, run a
literature-inspired proposal pass, implement a compatible algorithm change, or
request deterministic tunable suggestions as seeds.

Server aggregation is an open code-search surface. The agent may create a new
Python aggregator module, edit an existing allowed aggregator module, and
register it through `job.py`; it must not limit exploration to the job's
pre-existing FedAvg, FedAvgM, FedAdam, FedOpt, or SCAFFOLD options. Required
source-backed exploration is not aggregation-only: client optimizer, loss
function, learning-rate schedule, and architecture candidates within the fixed
comparison budget qualify equally.

## Simulator Recovery

For NVFLARE simulator runs, the server log can be quiet after it dispatches a
round while individual clients are still training. Before declaring a stall,
inspect the isolated result directory reported in the active `run.log` and
check `site-*/log.txt` or `site-*/log_fl.txt` for epoch, finished-training,
download, or task-completion progress. If any client log or server aggregation
marker advances within the expected candidate runtime, continue the same
candidate; do not stop the runner, final-answer, or start a new campaign.

If the active NVFLARE simulator logs show a hard child-process connection
failure such as
`Failed to create connection to the child process in SimulatorClientRunner`, or
if a dispatched simulator round has no advancing server/client progress markers
past the configured no-progress watchdog timeout, do not start a new campaign and
do not produce a final report. Treat only that active candidate as crashed,
terminate the stuck `job.py` child if the runner has not already done so,
preserve the same `job.py`, `autofl.yaml`, metric, environment, ledger, and
comparison budget, then continue the same campaign.

The product runner includes these simulator-stall watchdogs; prefer letting it
record the crash row, refresh artifacts, and launch the next candidate. For
legitimately long quiet tasks, raise `--simulator-no-progress-timeout`, set
`AUTOFL_SIMULATOR_NO_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, or set
`simulator_no_progress_timeout_seconds` in the task profile.

If the current process has already stopped but the user did not ask to stop, do
not leave the campaign in a terminal state. Inspect the campaign state and
ledger, fix the recoverable cause, and continue the same optimization with the
same `job.py`, `autofl.yaml`, metric, environment, and comparison budget.
