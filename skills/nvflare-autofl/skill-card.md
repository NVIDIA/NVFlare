## Description: <br>
Use for agent-assisted Auto-FL optimization of an existing NVFLARE job in simulation, POC, or production. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and ML engineers use this skill to iteratively optimize federated learning jobs through reproducible candidate campaigns managed by an automated campaign runner. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
7 evaluation tasks (7 positive) from skill-evaluator-dataset-snapshot/1. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was found and executed when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Verifies absence of unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Verifies final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies whether the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Verifies whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Verifies routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|
| Overall | 59% → 70% (+11 points) |
| Security | 86% → 86% (±0 points) |
| Correctness | 71% → 77% (+6 points) |
| Discoverability | 43% → 70% (+27 points) |
| Effectiveness | 46% → 48% (+2 points) |
| Efficiency | 47% → 69% (+22 points) |
