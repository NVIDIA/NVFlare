"""Packaged PyTorch Client API conversion template: paired training + evaluation.

Copy and adapt this into a generated ``client.py``. Adapt ``evaluate`` to the
source project's metric and validation loader; keep the source metric name and
averaging denominator rather than inventing new metric semantics. The received
global model is evaluated first so the server can do model selection, and the
metric is returned through ``FLModel.metrics``.

``evaluate`` is a pure function so a generated conversion can be validated
against a toy model and loader without a running FLARE server. The main loop
initializes FLARE, then builds model and training state once before FLARE
rounds; each round only loads received weights into that persistent state.
