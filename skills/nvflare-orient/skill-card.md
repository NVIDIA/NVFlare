## Description: <br>
Route open-ended NVFLARE advice and only conversion requests whose preliminary source inspection reports unresolved or conflicting ownership; never load this skill merely to inspect a concrete conversion request before selecting its detected framework converter. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to route ambiguous NVFLARE requests to the appropriate specific workflow skill after inspecting project evidence. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Reference(s): <br>
- [Orientation Routing Reference](references/orientation-routing.md) <br>
- [NVIDIA FLARE Documentation](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main) <br>


## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Analysis, Configuration instructions] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [None] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 6 tasks (6 positive) in isolated sandbox pods, each exercising orientation routing and evidence-based skill selection. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill avoids unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the expected skill was found and executed when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helps complete the user's goal and follows expected workflow behavior. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoids wasted tool or skill usage through quality routing. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
