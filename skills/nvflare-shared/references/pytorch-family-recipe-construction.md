# PyTorch-Family Recipe Construction

Use this reference after selecting a PyTorch-family recipe and running
`nvflare recipe show <recipe-name> --format json`. It is the canonical owner of
recipe-capability handling for plain PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, and Hugging
Face Trainer conversions.

## Derive A Capability Profile

The JSON returned by `recipe show` contains `data.parameters`, a list of
parameter objects whose `name` field is the public constructor keyword. Build
the exposed-name set from those fields. Treat a missing or malformed
`data.parameters` value as a failed capability check rather than guessing from
another recipe.

Only pass a recipe keyword when its name is in the exposed-name set. Do not copy
the FedAvg constructor shape to Cyclic, FedEval, Swarm, or another recipe.

Every recipe construction or construction preflight must include one model
source accepted by the selected recipe, such as `model`, `initial_ckpt`, or
`model_persistor`, and that keyword must be exposed by its capability profile.
For an ordinary conversion, follow the model-form policy in
`conversion-workflow.md` ("Recipe Model Config"). Never instantiate an
incomplete `FedAvgRecipe` merely to inspect
attributes or discover constructor behavior; use `recipe show` and non-raising
module/class attribute checks for capability discovery.

## Recipe API Boundary

`recipe show` validates only the selected recipe's module, class, and listed
constructor parameters. It does not advertise other symbols from
`nvflare.recipe` or define a separate export environment. For supported local
conversion validation, use `SimEnv` with `recipe.execute(...)`; export through
`python job.py --export --export-dir <dir>`.

Do not guess or directly import additional recipe-adjacent symbols. When the
selected public workflow genuinely requires another symbol, first use a
non-failing module attribute check such as `hasattr`; if it is absent, report a
version or skill-contract gap. Do not replace a failed local public check with
web search or SDK-source discovery.

Validate a recipe model's `class_path` through the public recipe construction,
export inspection, and bounded execution path. Do not import internal class
loader helpers, guess helper names, or inspect implementation source to build a
parallel validation path.

## Client Argument Transport

Treat `train_args` as a recipe-owned argument string, not automatically as a
POSIX shell command. Encode it according to the selected public execution
surface:

- For the default in-process Client API executor, pass whitespace-free values
  as unquoted tokens. Ordinary quote characters may be preserved literally.
- Use shell quoting such as `shlex.quote()` only when the selected documented
  launcher explicitly uses POSIX command tokenization.
- If a required path or identifier contains whitespace and the selected recipe
  exposes no documented structured or per-site argument surface, ask or fail
  closed rather than switching launch modes or inventing an encoding.

Do not import or call internal command-splitting helpers to predict argument
delivery. Validate the exact generated `train_args` end to end through the
selected recipe path and the generated client's actual parser.

### Per-Site Argument Overrides

Use one topology owner. The standard local path leaves `per_site_config` unset
and runs `SimEnv(num_clients=N, ...)`; generate site partitions from
`flare.get_site_name()` after `flare.init()` rather than creating one recipe
target per partition. Use `per_site_config` only for genuinely different site
paths or arguments. Once `set_per_site_config(recipe, per_site_config)` creates
named recipe targets, run them with
`SimEnv(clients=list(per_site_config), num_threads=len(per_site_config), ...)`.
Never also pass `num_clients`, and never use `num_clients=None` as a workaround.

Treat `per_site_config[site]["train_args"]` as the site's complete argument
string. When present, it replaces the recipe-level `train_args`; the recipe does
not merge shared arguments into the site override. Compose every site value from
the shared and site-specific arguments before calling `set_per_site_config(...)`:

```python
shared_train_args = f"--epochs {epochs} --batch-size {batch_size}"
per_site_config = {
    site: {"train_args": f"{shared_train_args} --data-dir {data_dir}"}
    for site, data_dir in site_data_dirs.items()
}
set_per_site_config(recipe, per_site_config)
```

Recipe-level `train_args` is only the fallback for a site without its own
`train_args` entry. Use the same mapping for Recipe and `SimEnv` construction so
both use the same target names. Before a full simulation, inspect each composed
site value
and verify that it contains the full expected argument set. For an exported-job
validation target, also inspect each site's exported client configuration and
verify that `task_script_args` contains the full expected argument set. For a
local-only `python job.py` target, let that selected run validate argument
delivery end to end; do not create an export only for this inspection. A partial
site override is a construction failure; do not discover it through repeated
full simulations.

## Tensor-Native Transport

Use the workflow-side format keyword exposed by the selected recipe:

- When `aggregation_format` is exposed, pass
  `aggregation_format=ExchangeFormat.PYTORCH`. This names the representation
  consumed by a client-side aggregation workflow such as Swarm.
- Otherwise, when `server_expected_format` is exposed, pass
  `server_expected_format=ExchangeFormat.PYTORCH`. This names the representation
  consumed by a server-side workflow.

Either form selects tensor-native transport. When tensor-native transport was selected, call
`recipe.add_decomposers(["nvflare.app_opt.pt.decomposers.TensorDecomposer"])`
after any `set_per_site_config(...)` call and before export or execution.

If neither workflow-side format keyword is exposed, preserve the recipe's
documented transport default and do not infer tensor-native transport from its
framework name. Register `TensorDecomposer` only when another public recipe
surface explicitly selects tensor-native transport. If the user requires
tensor-native transport and the selected recipe has no public way to select it,
report a recipe-capability gap instead of passing unsupported keywords or
switching recipes.

`pytorch-model-exchange.md` is the canonical owner of framework payload and
state-dict rules.

## Workflow Tensor Disk Offload

Disk offload is an aggregation-workflow memory optimization, not a
model-exchange format. It causes incoming streamed tensors to be downloaded to
temporary files on the aggregation host and materialized lazily during
aggregation instead of being deserialized into memory immediately, reducing
peak memory pressure and OOM risk.

When tensor-native transport was selected and `enable_tensor_disk_offload` is
exposed, pass `enable_tensor_disk_offload=True`. NVFLARE activates this
optimization only when the exposed workflow-side format is
`ExchangeFormat.PYTORCH`; otherwise it warns and treats the setting as a no-op.
Never pass the keyword to a recipe that does not expose it.

If the user requires disk offload and the selected recipe cannot expose both
tensor-native transport and `enable_tensor_disk_offload`, report a
recipe-capability gap instead of claiming that offload is enabled.

## Transfer Mode

When `params_transfer_type` is exposed, choose the mode that matches the user's
intent: `FULL` sends whole models and `DIFF` sends model differences. Do not pass
it when absent or infer a transfer mode from another recipe.

## Execution Mode Is Process-Based

Select execution mode from process-spawning or distributed-launch evidence, not
from GPU count:

- CPU, single-GPU, and single-process multi-GPU `torch.nn.DataParallel` stay
  in-process; leave `launch_external_process` unset.
- `DistributedDataParallel`, `torchrun`, `torch.distributed`, Lightning DDP
  strategies, or another source launch that creates distributed worker
  processes requires `launch_external_process=True`.

Before setting it, confirm `launch_external_process` is exposed. Also confirm
the recipe exposes `command`, `launcher`, or another public launch surface that
can preserve required distributed-launch arguments. If either capability is
missing, ask or fail closed rather than dropping the source process model.
Multiple requested GPUs without evidence of how the source uses them is not
enough to choose a process model; inspect the source, then ask or fail closed if
it remains ambiguous.

`launch_once` is the companion Client API knob and is framework-neutral: it
selects whether the external client process is launched once for the whole job
and reused for every task, or relaunched for each task/round. It belongs to the
recipe, not to any framework integration, and applies only when
`launch_external_process=True`. Confirm it is exposed before passing it and keep
the recipe default (`True`) unless the source genuinely requires a fresh process
per task. A framework integration may constrain this value — an integration that
keeps one persistent trainer alive across rounds cannot use `launch_once=False`
— so check the framework skill's delta before overriding the default.

## Simulator Concurrency

Do not reduce simulator `num_threads` below the requested client count as a
speculative memory workaround for an in-process Client API executor with tensor
offload. Use a lower thread count only when the selected execution mode
documents that behavior and a bounded smoke test verifies it. After partial
aggregation, unexplained client disconnect, or process loss, inspect logs and
reduce the model/data workload or report a resource blocker. Do not retry the
same large payload with guessed concurrency settings.

## Best-Model Filename

When customizing a best-model artifact name, pass `best_model_filename` only
when the selected recipe exposes it. Do not also pass `save_filename`; it is a
deprecated alias, and conflicting values make recipe construction fail. Omit
both when the default artifact name is acceptable. If customization is required
but `best_model_filename` is absent, report the capability gap.

## Best-Model Metric

Only configure a source-derived `key_metric` when the recipe exposes it and the
selected execution path delivers that exact metric to the server. A local
evaluation call, `self.log`, or client log does not by itself prove server
delivery. If delivery is unavailable or unverified, do not pass a source-derived
`key_metric` or claim server-side best-model selection; report the execution-path
limitation instead. The Lightning conversion guidance documents the explicit
training-result metric bridge and its DDP validation requirements.

When both preconditions hold, select a source-backed metric and its direction.
Its name must exactly match one key delivered by the client in
`FLModel.metrics` (or by the Lightning integration). For example, a delivered
client metric named `f1` uses `key_metric="f1", key_metric_mode="max"` when the
resolved recipe exposes the mode parameter.

When best-model selection is requested for a lower-is-better source metric and
the recipe exposes `key_metric_mode`, preserve the source value and pass
`key_metric_mode="min"`; for example, use `key_metric="val_loss"`. Only when a
resolved recipe lacks a direction parameter, send a clearly named negated
compatibility metric and select that key. Never select a raw loss key with max
direction, and do not fail closed merely because loss is the only available
metric.

Do not rely on a recipe default when explicitly selecting a source metric unless
the client emits that exact metric, and ask or fail closed when the metric
direction is unclear — not merely because the only available metric is a loss.
Do not pass `key_metric` when the recipe does not expose it.

Resolve model selection to exactly one state before constructing the recipe:

- **Disabled:** Best-model selection is not requested. When the recipe exposes
  `key_metric` and documents empty-string disabling, pass `key_metric=""`.
  Omitting the argument is not disabling when the recipe has a non-empty
  default. If the selected recipe cannot disable selection, report the
  capability gap.
- **Metric:** Best-model selection is requested and an exact client metric with
  known direction is available. Pass that non-empty key and the supported
  direction parameter.
- **Recipe default:** Accept the documented default only deliberately, when the
  client delivers that exact key. Omit `key_metric` and report the resolved
  default; never use this state as a fallback for an unavailable metric.

After export, inspect the server configuration. The disabled state must contain
no active model-selector component. The metric and recipe-default states must
contain a selector with the resolved key. Treat a mismatch, or missing-metric
warnings from a supposedly disabled job, as validation failure.
