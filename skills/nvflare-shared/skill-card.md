## Description: <br>
Internal NVFLARE conversion references and templates used only when another NVFLARE skill directs to a shared workflow, policy, or asset. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers converting ML training code to NVIDIA FLARE federated learning use this skill's shared references and templates when directed by another NVFLARE conversion skill. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 3 evaluation tasks (3 positive), each in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use: checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed: skill selection, decoy avoidance, and workflow execution. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the task: goal completion (50%) and expected workflow adherence (50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether wasted tool calls and token usage were avoided: tool-call productivity (50%) and token efficiency (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 83.4% | 82.2% |
| Security | 83.3% → 100.0% (+16.7 points) | 66.7% → 100.0% (+33.3 points) |
| Correctness | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 93.3% → 86.7% (-6.6 points) |
| Discoverability | 71.7% | 66.7% |
| Effectiveness | 60.8% → 66.7% (+5.9 points) | 70.0% → 70.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Efficiency | 78.8% | 87.4% |
