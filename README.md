[NVIDIA FLARE](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/2.3/index.html) is a domain-agnostic, open-source, extensible SDK that 
allows researchers and data scientists to adapt existing ML/DL workflows(PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost etc.) 
to a federated paradigm. It enables platform developers to build a secure, privacy-preserving offering 
for a distributed multi-party collaboration. 

**NVIDIA FLARE** is built on a componentized architecture that allows you to take federated learning workloads 
from research and simulation to real-world production deployment. Key components include:

* Support both deep learning and traditional machine algorithms
* Support horizontal and vertical federated learning
* Built-in FL algorithms (e.g., FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, Scaffold, Ditto )
* Support multiple training workflows (e.g., scatter & gather, cyclic) and validation workflows (global model evaluation, cross-site validation)
* Support both data analytics (federated statistics) and machine learning lifecycle management
* Privacy preservation with differential privacy, homomorphic encryption
* Security enforcement through federated authorization and privacy policy 
* Easily customizable and extensible
* Deployment on cloud and on premise 
* Simulator for rapid development and prototyping
* Dashboard UI for simplified project management and deployment
* Built-in support for system resiliency and fault tolerance
