[NVIDIA FLARE](https://nvidia.github.io/NVFlare/) (**NV**IDIA **F**ederated **L**earning **A**pplication **R**untime **E**nvironment)
is a domain-agnostic, open-source, extensible Python SDK that allows researchers and data scientists to adapt existing ML/DL workflows to a federated paradigm.
It enables platform developers to build a secure, privacy-preserving offering for a distributed multi-party collaboration.

## Features
FLARE is built on a componentized architecture that allows you to take federated learning workloads
from research and simulation to real-world production deployment.

Application Features
* Support both deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithms (eg. PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost etc.)
* Support horizontal and vertical federated learning
* Built-in Federated Learning algorithms (e.g., FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, Scaffold, Ditto, etc.)
* Support multiple server and client-controlled training workflows (e.g., scatter & gather, cyclic) and validation workflows (global model evaluation, cross-site validation)
* Support both data analytics (federated statistics) and machine learning lifecycle management
* Privacy preservation with differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, private set intersection (PSI)

From Simulation to Real-World
* FLARE Client API to transition seamlessly from ML/DL to FL with minimal code changes
* Simulator and POC mode for rapid development and prototyping
* Fully customizable and extensible components with modular design
* Deployment on cloud and on-premise
* Dashboard for project management and deployment
* Security enforcement through federated authorization and privacy policy
* Built-in support for system resiliency and fault tolerance
