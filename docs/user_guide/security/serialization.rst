Message Serialization
=====================
NVFLARE uses a secure mechanism called FOBS (Flare OBject Serializer) for message serialization and
deserialization when exchanging data between the server and clients.

See :github_nvflare_link:`README <nvflare/fuel/utils/fobs/README.rst>` for usage guidelines.
