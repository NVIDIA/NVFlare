Client API Usage
################

The FLARE Client API provides an easy way for users to convert their centralized,
local training code into federated learning code with the following benefits:

* Only requires a few lines of code changes, without the need to restructure the code or implement a new class
* Reduces the number of new FLARE specific concepts exposed to users
* Easy adaptation from existing local training code using different frameworks
  (PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, HuggingFace)

Core concept
============

The general structure of the popular federated learning (FL) workflow, "FedAvg" is as follows:

#. FL server initializes an initial model
#. For each round (global iteration):

   #. FL server sends the global model to clients
   #. Each FL client starts with this global model and trains on their own data
   #. Each FL client sends back their trained model
   #. FL server aggregates all the models and produces a new global model

On the client side, the training workflow is as follows:

#. Receive the model from the FL server
#. Perform local training on the received global model and/or evaluate the
   received global model for model selection
#. Send the new model back to the FL server

To convert a centralized training code to federated learning, we need to
adapt the code to do the following steps:

#. Obtain the required information from received :ref:`fl_model`
#. Run local training
#. Put the results in a new :ref:`fl_model` to be sent back

For a general use case, there are three essential methods for the Client API:

* ``init()``: Initializes NVFlare Client API environment.
* ``receive()``: Receives model from NVFlare side.
* ``send()``: Sends the model to NVFlare side.

Users can use the Client API to change their centralized training code to
federated learning, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    import nvflare.client as flare

    flare.init() # 1. Initializes NVFlare Client API environment.
    input_model = flare.receive() # 2. Receives model from NVFlare side.
    params = input_model.params # 3. Obtain the required information from received FLModel

    # original local training code begins
    new_params = local_train(params)
    # original local training code ends

    output_model = flare.FLModel(params=new_params) # 4. Put the results in a new FLModel
    flare.send(output_model) # 5. Sends the model to NVFlare side.

With 5 lines of code changes, we convert the centralized training code to
federated learning setting.

After this, we can utilize the job templates and the :ref:`job_cli`
to generate a job so it can be run using :ref:`fl_simulator`
or submit to a deployed NVFlare system.
