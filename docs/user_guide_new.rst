This guide is for data scientists and ML engineers who want to use NVIDIA FLARE for federated learning applications.

Start with the :ref:`Client API <client_api>` to convert existing training code to federated, then use the
:ref:`Job Recipe API <job_recipe>` for pre-built FL algorithms.

For low-level APIs and system internals, see the :ref:`Architecture & Developer Guide <developer_guide>`.
