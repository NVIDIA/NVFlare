Contributing
============

Welcome to NVIDIA FLARE! We're excited you're here and want to
contribute. This documentation is intended for individuals and
institutions interested in contributing to NVIDIA FLARE. NVIDIA FLARE is
an open-source project and, as such, its success relies on its community
of contributors willing to keep improving it. Your contribution will be
a valued addition to the code base; we simply ask that you read this
page and understand our contribution process, whether you are a seasoned
open-source contributor or whether you are a first-time contributor.

Communicate with us
-------------------

We are happy to talk with you about your needs for NVIDIA FLARE and your
ideas for contributing to the project. One way to do this is to create
an issue discussing your thoughts. It might be that a very similar
feature is under development or already exists, so an issue is a great
starting point.

The contribution process
------------------------

*Pull request early*

We encourage you to create pull requests early. It helps us track the
contributions under development, whether they are ready to be merged or
not. Change your pull request's title, to begin with ``[WIP]`` and/or
`create a draft pull
request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests>`__
until it is ready for formal review.

Preparing pull requests
-----------------------

To ensure the code quality, NVIDIA FLARE relies on several linting tools
(`flake8 and its plugins <https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8>`__,
`black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__ and
`isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort>`__)

This section highlights all the necessary preparation steps required
before sending a pull request. To collaborate efficiently, please read
through this section and follow them.

-  `Checking the coding style <#checking-the-coding-style>`__
-  `Unit testing <#unit-testing>`__
-  `Building documentation <#building-the-documentation>`__
-  `Signing your work <#signing-your-work>`__

Checking the coding style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We check code style using flake8 and isort. A bash script
(``runtest.sh``) is provided to run all tests locally.

License information: all source code files should start with this
paragraph:

Unit testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

NVIDIA FLARE tests are located under tests/. The unit test file names
follow the ``[module_name]_test.py`` pattern.

The bash script ``runtest.sh`` will run unit tests also.

.. _building-docs:

Building the documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use a dedicated documentation environment to preserve training dependencies.
From the repository root, create and activate a new environment, then build:

.. code:: bash

   python3.10 -m venv .venv-docs
   source .venv-docs/bin/activate
   ./build_doc.sh --html

The script installs the documentation dependencies. Linux x86_64 with Python 3.10
uses the same pinned CPU framework environment as Read the Docs; other supported
environments use the documentation extra. Keep this environment separate from
the development or training environment.

Open ``docs/_build/index.html`` to read the generated HTML. To clean generated files:

.. code:: bash

   ./build_doc.sh --clean

The production dependency pins are in ``docs/constraints.txt``. Update them in a
fresh documentation environment and verify the full HTML and Markdown build
before committing new versions.

Signing your work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NVIDIA FLARE enforces the `Developer Certificate of
Origin <https://developercertificate.org/>`__ (DCO) on all pull
requests.

For a detailed guide on signing commits, please see `Signing
commits <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits>`__
from GitHub.

Commit signature verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NVIDIA FLARE enforces commit signature verification, a security feature
provided by GitHub. Developers are required to setup GPG keys as
described in `Commit Signature
Verification <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#gpg-commit-signature-verification>`__.

   Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

   By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

   (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
       have the right to submit it under the open source license
       indicated in the file; or

   (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
       of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
       license and I have the right under that license to submit that
       work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
       by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
       permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
       in the file; or

   (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
       person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
       it.

   (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
       are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
       personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
       maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
       this project or the open source license(s) involved.

Submitting pull requests
------------------------

All code changes to the ``main`` branch must be done via `pull
requests <https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests>`__.

Every pull request must reference an existing GitHub issue in NVIDIA/NVFlare
that describes the problem or proposed improvement, explains why the change
is needed, and provides supporting evidence where applicable.
The issue must exist before the pull request is submitted, and the proposed
changes must directly address it.
Pull requests without a qualifying issue will not be accepted.

1. Create a new ticket or take a known ticket from `the issue
list <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/issues>`__. 2. If the task has not been
taken, `create a new branch in your
fork <https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`__
of the codebase. Ideally, the new branch should be based on the latest
``main`` branch. 3. Make changes to the branch (`use detailed commit
messages if possible <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`__). 4.
Make sure that new tests cover the changes and the changed codebase
`passes all tests locally <#unit-testing>`__. 5. `Create a new pull
request <https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request>`__
from the task branch to the ``main`` branch, with detailed descriptions of
the purpose of this pull request. 6. Check `the CI/CD status of the pull
request <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/actions>`__, make sure all
CI/CD tests passed. 7. Wait for reviews; if there are
reviews, make point-to-point responses, make further code changes if
needed. 8. If there are conflicts between the pull request branch and
the ``main`` branch, pull the changes from ``main`` and resolve the
conflicts locally. 9. Reviewer and contributor may have discussions
back and forth until all comments addressed. All conversations must be
resolved for PR to pass. 10. Wait for the pull request to be merged.

Reviewing pull requests
-----------------------

Before reviewing the code, verify that the linked GitHub issue exists,
predates the pull request, and is directly addressed by the proposed changes.
Maintainers must confirm that the issue identifies a valid problem or an
improvement appropriate for the project before approving the pull request.

All code review comments should be specific, constructive, and
actionable. 1. Check `the CI/CD status of the pull
request <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/actions>`__, make sure all
CI/CD tests passed before reviewing (contact the branch owner if
needed). 1. Read carefully the descriptions of the pull request and the
files changed, write comments if needed. 1. Make in-line comments to
specific code segments, `request for
changes <https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews>`__
if needed. 1. Review any further code changes until all comments
addressed by the contributors. 1. Merge the pull request to the main
branch. 1. Close the corresponding task ticket on `the issue
list <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/issues>`__.
