NVIDIA FLARE UNIQUE FEATURES
-----------------------------

What is FLARE's unique feature comparing with other closed or open-source framework

* FLARE's position
  We are not trying to all inclusive federated learning platform, we only position to be a library
  that can enable the other system.
  We can be used independently for any federated learning research and application, but we can easily
  be integrated as the Federated Kernel of other system.

* FLARE's Runtime Flexibility and Unique design
  FLARE is designed in several layers:
  * flare-core layer has no dependent on machine learning
  * federated learning layer is a federated computing applications on top of federated-core
  * all layers are specification-based, pluggable components, can be easily customized

* FLARE will provide state of art Federated Learning Algorithms
  FLARE team assembled the world-class machine learning and deep learning experts.
  They will constantly adding new Federated learning algorithm to enrich the FLARE algorithms repository

* Leverage NVIDIA's unique GPU knowledge
  Although FLARE has no dependency on GPU, and can be used on both CPU and GPU,
  we can leverage NVIDIA's GPU acceleration technology when GPU is used,
  especially in federated deep learning is involved.

* Real World Adaptions
  Several hospitals, platform and academic institutions have adapted FLARE.
  many more are actively engaged for collaboration and integrations.
