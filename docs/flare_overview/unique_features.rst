Unique Features
===============

What makes FLARE unique compared to other closed- or open-source frameworks for Federated Learning?

* FLARE's position
  We are not trying to be an all-inclusive federated learning platform.  Our primary goal is to build a library
  that can enable federated learning systems.

  We provide reference implementations of commonly-used tools and algorigthms so that FLARE can be used
  independently for federated learning research and applications.  Because the FLARE API is open and
  specification-based, we can just as easily be integrated as the Federated Kernel of another Federated Learning
  system.

* FLARE's Runtime Flexibility and Unique design
  FLARE is designed in several layers:
  
  * The Flare-Core layer has no dependency on machine learning or deep learning frameworks.
  * The FLARE-FL layer is a collection of federated computing algorithms and applications on top of FLARE-Core.
  * All layers are specification-based, pluggable components that can be easily customized.

* FLARE will provide state of art Federated Learning algorithms
  The FLARE team assembled world-class researchers in machine learning and deep learning who
  are constantly adding new Federated Learning algorithms and tools to enrich the repository of
  algorithms and examples built on the FLARE-Core runtime.

* FLARE leverages NVIDIA's unique GPU knowledge
  Although FLARE has no direct dependency on GPUs and can be used on both CPU and GPU,
  we can leverage NVIDIA's GPU acceleration technology when GPUs are used.
  This is especially valuable for applications in in Federated Deep Learning and Acclerated Computing.

* Real World Experience
  Several hospitals, platforms and academic institutions have already adopted FLARE
  to solve real-world problems.  The learnings from these engagements are continually integrated
  to improve the core capabilities of the FLARE platform.  We continue to engage with the community
  with many active collaborations and integrations.
