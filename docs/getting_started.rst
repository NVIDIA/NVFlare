This guide will help you understand the different ways to run NVIDIA FLARE and get started with your federated learning journey.
Before proceeding, make sure you have completed the :ref:`quickstart` guide to run your first example.

Ways to Run NVFlare
==================
NVFlare supports different running modes to accommodate various use cases, from development to production:

.. list-table:: NVIDIA FLARE Modes
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Mode**
     - **Documentation**
     - **Description**
   * - Simulator
     - :ref:`fl_simulator`
     - | The FL Simulator is a light weight simulation where the job run is automated on a 
       | single system. Useful for quickly running a job or experimenting with research 
       | or FL algorithms.
   * - POC
     - :ref:`poc_command`
     - | POC mode establishes and connects distinct server and client "systems" which can 
       | then be orchestrated using the FLARE Console all from a single machine. Users can 
       | also experiment with various deployment options (project.yml), which can be used 
       | in production modes.
   * - Production
     - :ref:`provisioned_setup`
     - | Real world production mode involves a distributed deployment with generated startup 
       | kits from the provisioning process. Provides provisioning tool, dashboard, and 
       | various deployment options.
