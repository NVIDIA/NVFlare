This user guide provides instructions on how to utilize various features in NVIDIA FLARE.

.. tip::

    **New to FLARE?** Start with the :ref:`available_recipes` to see ready-to-use federated learning algorithms including FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, XGBoost, and more.

For a more in-depth exploration of the capabilities offered by apps with custom workflows and algorithms,
please refer to the :ref:`programming_guide`.

**Data Scientists**: Users focused on federated learning applications.
They are less interested in developing custom algorithms or workflow patterns; applying existing FL algorithms to real-world applications is their focus.
Please check :ref:`data_scientist_guide`

**Integration Developers & Researchers**: Developers building platforms powered by NVIDIA FLARE, or researchers who need to experiment and customize both client and server code to develop new workflows.
Please refer to :ref:`programming_guide` for APIs and advanced topics.
