Custom Code in Example Apps
===========================
There are several ways to make :ref:`custom code <custom_code>` available to clients when using NVIDIA FLARE. Most
hello-* examples use a custom folder within the FL application. Note that using a custom folder in the app needs to be
:ref:`allowed <troubleshooting_byoc>` when using secure provisioning. By default, this option is disabled in the secure
mode. POC mode, however, will work with custom code by default.

In contrast, the `CIFAR-10 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/cifar10>`_,
`prostate segmentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/prostate>`_,
and `BraTS18 segmentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/brats18>`_ examples assume that the
learner code is already installed on the client's system and
available in the PYTHONPATH. Hence, the app folders do not include the custom code there. The PYTHONPATH is
set in the ``run_poc.sh`` or ``run_secure.sh`` scripts of the example. Running these scripts as described in the README
will make the learner code available to the clients.
