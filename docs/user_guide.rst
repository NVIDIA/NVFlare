User Guide

This user guide has information about various features in NVIDIA FLARE.

For information about operating an FL system, see :ref:`Real-World Federated Learning <real_world_fl>`.

For more details on what you can do with apps with custom components and
the flexibility that the Controller and Worker APIs bring, see the :ref:`programming_guide`.

In version 2.2, the commands for NVIDIA FLARE have been consolidated to be under the ``nvflare`` command for
better ease of use. This includes the FL Simulator, the POC command, ``provision``, and preflight check, all of
which are explained in more detail in their own sections linked below.
