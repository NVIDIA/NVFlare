This section provides a starting point for new users to learn some basic concepts about NVIDIA FLARE.
Users can work through these examples and gradually get familiar with how NVIDIA FLARE is designed, operates and works.

The learning path of these examples starts with hello_pt (a PyTorch example) and ends with hello_tf2 (a Tensorflow 2 example).
Each example introduces new concepts about NVIDIA FLARE, while showcasing how some popular libraries and frameworks can
easily be integrated into the FL process.
