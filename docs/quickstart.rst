Welcome to the NVIDIA FLARE Quick Start Series! This guide provides a set of hello-world examples to help you quickly learn how to build federated learning programs using NVIDIA FLARE.

Make sure you have completed the :ref:`installation` steps before proceeding.

Prerequisites
=============

- Python 3.9+
- pip
- Git
- NVFlare installed (see :ref:`installation`)

Hello-world Examples
