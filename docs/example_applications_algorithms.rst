Custom Code in Example Apps
===========================
There are several ways to make :ref:`custom code <custom_code>` available to clients when using NVIDIA FLARE.
Most hello-* examples use a custom folder within the FL application.
Note that using a custom folder in the app needs to be :ref:`allowed <troubleshooting_byoc>` when using secure provisioning.
By default, this option is disabled in the secure mode. POC mode, however, will work with custom code by default.

In contrast, the `CIFAR-10 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/cifar10>`_,
`prostate segmentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/prostate>`_,
and `BraTS18 segmentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/brats18>`_ examples assume that the
learner code is already installed on the client's system and available in the PYTHONPATH.
Hence, the app folders do not include the custom code there.
The PYTHONPATH is set in the ``run_poc.sh`` or ``run_secure.sh`` scripts of the example.
Running these scripts as described in the README will make the learner code available to the clients.

Federated Learning Algorithms
=============================

Federated Averaging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In NVIDIA FLARE, FedAvg is implemented through the :ref:`scatter_and_gather_workflow`. In the federated averaging workflow,
a set of initial weights is distributed to client workers who perform local training.  After local training, clients
return their local weights as a Shareables that are aggregated (averaged).  This new set of global average weights is
redistributed to clients and the process repeats for the specified number of rounds.

FedProx
^^^^^^^
`FedProx <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127>`_ implements a :class:`Loss function <nvflare.app_common.pt.pt_fedproxloss.PTFedProxLoss>`
to penalize a clientâ€™s local weights based on deviation from the global model. An example configuration can be found in
cifar10_fedprox of the `CIFAR-10 example <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/cifar10>`_.

FedOpt
^^^^^^
`FedOpt <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00295>`_ implements a :class:`ShareableGenerator <nvflare.app_common.pt.pt_fedopt.PTFedOptModelShareableGenerator>`
that can use a specified Optimizer and Learning Rate Scheduler when updating the global model. An example configuration
can be found in cifar10_fedopt of `CIFAR-10 example <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/cifar10>`_.

SCAFFOLD
^^^^^^^^
`SCAFFOLD <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06378>`_ uses a slightly modified version of the CIFAR-10 Learner implementation,
namely the `CIFAR10ScaffoldLearner`, which adds a correction term during local training following the `implementation <https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/NIID-Bench>`_
as described in `Li et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02079>`_

Ditto
^^^^^
`Ditto <https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04221>`_ uses a slightly modified version of the prostate Learner implementation,
namely the `ProstateDittoLearner`, which decouples local personalized model from global model via an additional model
training and a controllable prox term. See the `prostate segmentation example <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/prostate>`_
for an example with ditto in addition to FedProx, FedAvg, and centralized training.

Federated Analytics
-------------------
Federated analytics may be used to gather information about the data at various sites. An example can be found in the
`Federated Analysis example <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/federated_analysis>`_.
