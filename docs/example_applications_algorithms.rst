Setting up a virtual environment for examples and notebooks
===========================================================
It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies for the examples. Install dependencies for a virtual environment with:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv


Once venv is installed, you can use it to create a virtual environment with:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python3 -m venv nvflare_example

This will create the ``nvflare_example`` directory in current working directory if it doesn't exist,
and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter,
the standard library, and various supporting files.


Activate the virtualenv by running the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ source nvflare_example/bin/activate

Installing required packages
----------------------------
In each example folder, install required packages for training:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

(optional) some examples contain scripts for plotting the TensorBoard event files, if needed, please also install the additional requirements in the example folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r plot-requirements.txt


JupyterLab with your virtual environment for Notebooks
------------------------------------------------------
To run examples including notebooks, we recommend using `JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io>`_.

After activating your virtual environment, install JupyterLab:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install jupyterlab

If you need to register the virtual environment you created so it is usable in JupyterLab, you can register the kernel with:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m ipykernel install --user --name="nvflare_example"

Start a Jupyter Lab:

.. code-block:: bash

  jupyter lab .

When you open a notebook, select the kernel you registered, "nvflare_example", using the dropdown menu at the top right.

Custom Code in Example Apps
===========================
There are several ways to make :ref:`custom code <custom_code>` available to clients when using NVIDIA FLARE.
Most hello-* examples use a custom folder within the FL application.
Note that using a custom folder in the app needs to be :ref:`allowed <troubleshooting_byoc>` when using secure provisioning.
By default, this option is disabled in the secure mode. POC mode, however, will work with custom code by default.

In contrast, the :github_nvflare_link:`CIFAR-10 <examples/cifar10>`,
:github_nvflare_link:`prostate segmentation <examples/prostate>`,
and :github_nvflare_link:`BraTS18 segmentation <examples/brats18>` examples assume that the
learner code is already installed on the client's system and available in the PYTHONPATH.
Hence, the app folders do not include the custom code there.
The PYTHONPATH is set in the ``run_poc.sh`` or ``run_secure.sh`` scripts of the example.
Running these scripts as described in the README will make the learner code available to the clients.

Federated Learning Algorithms
=============================

Federated Averaging
-------------------
In NVIDIA FLARE, FedAvg is implemented through the :ref:`scatter_and_gather_workflow`. In the federated averaging workflow,
a set of initial weights is distributed to client workers who perform local training.  After local training, clients
return their local weights as a Shareables that are aggregated (averaged).  This new set of global average weights is
redistributed to clients and the process repeats for the specified number of rounds.

FedProx
-------
`FedProx <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127>`_ implements a :class:`Loss function <nvflare.app_common.pt.pt_fedproxloss.PTFedProxLoss>`
to penalize a client's local weights based on deviation from the global model. An example configuration can be found in
cifar10_fedprox of the :github_nvflare_link:`CIFAR-10 example <examples/cifar10>`.

FedOpt
------
`FedOpt <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00295>`_ implements a :class:`ShareableGenerator <nvflare.app_common.pt.pt_fedopt.PTFedOptModelShareableGenerator>`
that can use a specified Optimizer and Learning Rate Scheduler when updating the global model. An example configuration
can be found in cifar10_fedopt of :github_nvflare_link:`CIFAR-10 example <examples/cifar10>`.

SCAFFOLD
--------
`SCAFFOLD <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06378>`_ uses a slightly modified version of the CIFAR-10 Learner implementation,
namely the `CIFAR10ScaffoldLearner`, which adds a correction term during local training following the `implementation <https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/NIID-Bench>`_
as described in `Li et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02079>`_

Ditto
-----
`Ditto <https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04221>`_ uses a slightly modified version of the prostate Learner implementation,
namely the `ProstateDittoLearner`, which decouples local personalized model from global model via an additional model
training and a controllable prox term. See the :github_nvflare_link:`prostate segmentation example <examples/prostate>`
for an example with ditto in addition to FedProx, FedAvg, and centralized training.
