NVIDIA FLARE (NVIDIA Federated Learning Application Runtime Environment) is a domain-agnostic, open-source, extensible SDK that allows
researchers and data scientists to adapt existing ML/DL workflows (PyTorch, RAPIDS, Nemo, TensorFlow) to a federated paradigm; and enables
platform developers to build a secure, privacy preserving offering for a distributed multi-party collaboration.

Getting Started
===============
To get started with NVIDIA FLARE:

1. Read the :ref:`Welcome <welcome>` page for a quick overview of FLARE and its capabilities
2. Follow the :ref:`installation` guide to set up your environment
3. Run through the :ref:`quickstart` guide to try your first example
4. Explore more examples in the :ref:`Examples & Tutorials <examples_tutorials>` section

For New Users
=============
If you are new to FLARE, we recommend starting with the :ref:`Client API <client_api>` and :ref:`Job Recipe API <job_recipe>` --
these higher-level APIs let you convert existing ML training code to federated with minimal changes.

See the :ref:`User Guide <user_guide>` for detailed usage instructions.

For Deployment & Security
=========================
When you are ready for production, the :ref:`Deployment & Operations <deployment_operations>` section covers provisioning, deployment, and operations.
The :ref:`Security <security>` section covers authentication, authorization, data privacy, and auditing.

For Developers
==============
For deep dives into FLARE architecture, custom workflows, and low-level APIs, see the
:ref:`Architecture & Developer Guide <developer_guide>` and the :ref:`API Reference <apidocs/modules>`.
