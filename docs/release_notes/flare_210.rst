What's New in FLARE v2.1
=========================
FLARE 2.1 was the original release in June 2022 introducing HA and Multi-Job Execution:

    - :ref:`High Availability (HA) <high_availability>` supports multiple FL servers and automatically fails over 
      to another server when the currently active server becomes unavailable.
    - :ref:`Multi-Job Execution <multi_job>` supports resource-based multi-job execution by allowing for concurrent runs
      provided resources required by the jobs are satisfied.
