.. note::
   This guide is coming soon. It will cover performance optimization techniques
   for NVIDIA FLARE deployments.

Overview
========

This guide covers techniques for optimizing NVIDIA FLARE performance in production
deployments, including communication optimization, aggregation tuning, and
resource management.

Communication Optimization
============================

*Coming soon.* Will cover:

- Message compression and quantization (see :doc:`/programming_guide/message_quantization`)
- Bandwidth estimation and tuning
- gRPC configuration tuning
- Network latency mitigation strategies

Aggregation Performance
========================

*Coming soon.* Will cover:

- Server-side aggregation optimization
- Partial participation strategies
- Asynchronous aggregation tuning

Memory & Resource Management
==============================

*Coming soon.* Will cover:

- Memory management for large models (see :doc:`/programming_guide/memory_management`)
- GPU memory optimization
- Tensor downloading for memory-constrained environments (see :doc:`/programming_guide/tensor_downloader`)

Scaling Guidelines
==================

*Coming soon.* Will cover:

- Scaling from 2 clients to 100+ clients
- Hardware sizing recommendations
- Network bandwidth requirements
- Hierarchical architecture for large-scale deployments (see :ref:`flare_hierarchical_architecture`)
