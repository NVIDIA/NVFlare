Accessing the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the job is finished, you can issue the ``download_job [JOB_ID]``
in the admin client to download the results.

`[JOB_ID]` is the ID assigned by the system when submitting the job.

The result will be downloaded to your admin workspace
(the exact download path will be displayed when running the command).

The download workspace will be in ``[DOWNLOAD_DIR]/[JOB_ID]/workspace/``.
