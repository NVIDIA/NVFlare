This section shows how to use NVIDIA FLARE to deploy and operate an FL system.
A reference application will be used here to show provisioning and basic operation
of the system through the admin client. You will find information here about setting up the
system with all the available components and the Admin API for
operating FL. For more details on what you can do with apps with custom components and
the flexibility that the Controller and Worker APIs bring, see the :ref:`programming_guide`.

You can also see some `example applications <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples>`_ integrating with
`Clara Train <https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/clara-train-sdk/>`_ and
`MONAI <https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/master/federated_learning/nvflare>`_
to see the capabilities of the system and how it can be operated.
