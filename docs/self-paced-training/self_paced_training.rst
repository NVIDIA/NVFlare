The 12-chapter course offers a comprehensive overview of FLARE, covering topics such as running federated learning applications, algorithms, system architecture, experimental tracking, system monitoring, and industrial applications. While each notebook can be run independently, and you have the option to skip certain chapters or sections, it is recommended to follow them sequentially. With 100+ notebooks and 88+ videos, this tutorial is a comprehensive guide to federated learning with FLARE.

**Part 1: Introduction to Federated Learning**
This section focuses on running and developing federated learning applications using a simulator.
See: `Part 1: Introduction to Federated Learning <part-1/part_1.rst>`_

**Part 2: Federated Learning System**
Here, we explore NVIDIA FLARE's federated learning/computing system, including its architecture, deployment process, simulation of deployments, and system interactions.
See: `Part 2: Federated Learning System <part-2/part_2.rst>`_

**Part 3: Security and Privacy**
After understanding the basics of federated learning applications and systems, we delve into privacy and security aspects. This includes discussions on privacy concerns, various Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), and enterprise security support.
See: `Part 3: Security and Privacy <part-3/part_3.rst>`_

**Part 4: Advanced Topics in Federated Learning**
This section covers advanced topics in federated learning, such as:

- Various federated learning algorithms like FedOpt and FedProx.
- Different federated learning workflows, including cyclic, split learning, and swarm learning.
- Training or fine-tuning large language models.
- Secure federated XGBoost training.
- A comparison of FLARE's high-level and low-level APIs, with a focus on the powerful low-level APIs.
