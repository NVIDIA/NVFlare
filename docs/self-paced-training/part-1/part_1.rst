Part 1: Introduction to Federated Learning
========================================

We will use two chapters to illustrate how to run and develop federated learning applications.

In Part 1, we will explore the fundamentals of federated learning. We will cover:

`Chapter 1: Running Federated Learning Applications <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/examples/tutorials/self-paced-training/part-1_federated_learning_introduction/chapter-1_running_federated_learning_applications/01.0_introduction/introduction.ipynb>`_

- How to train an image classification model with PyTorch
- How to convert standard PyTorch training code to federated learning code
- How to customize client and server-side logic
- Understanding federated job structure and configurations

`Chapter 2: Develop Federated Learning Applications <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/main/examples/tutorials/self-paced-training/part-1_federated_learning_introduction/chapter-2_develop_federated_learning_applications/02.0_introduction/introduction.ipynb>`_

- Federated statistics for both image and tabular data
- Converting PyTorch Lightning to federated learning
- Converting traditional ML training code to federated learning code
- FLARE Client API
