Part 2: Federated Computing System
========================================

In Part 2, we will delve into the NVIDIA Federated Computing System. We will explore the system architecture, core concepts, and the process of setting up a Federated Computing System. Additionally, we will simulate the deployment of the federated computing system on a local host.

We will further discuss different ways for users to interact with a Federated Learning System. These include admin console commands, Python API, and command-line commands.

Finally, we will look at how to monitor system events using Prometheus and Grafana.
