# NVIDIA FLARE Integration test

## Setup

Note that the HA test cases are using `./data/project.yml` to provision the whole system.
That will require we have `localhost0` and `localhost1` map to `127.0.0.1`.
You need to either modify `/etc/hosts` file before running the test.
Or if you are running using docker container you should use `--add-host localhost0:127.0.0.1`.

## Run

First switch to this folder and then run

`PYTHONPATH=[path/to/your/NVFlare] ./run_integration_tests.sh`

You can also choose to run just one set of tests using "-m" option.

`PYTHONPATH=[path/to/your/NVFlare] ./run_integration_tests.sh -m [test options]`

---
**NOTE**

There are 7 options: numpy, tensorflow, pytorch, ha, auth, overseer, preflight.
The overseer and preflight tests have their own entry file.
All other options share the same test entry file `tests/integration_test/system_test.py`

---

## Test structure

The integration tests has 3 entry files:
  - The integration tests entry file is `tests/integration_test/system_test.py`.
    It will read all test configurations from `./test_configs.yml`.
    
    By default, it will run all the test configs.
    If specified, the chosen set of test configs will be run.
  - The overseer tests entry file is `tests/integration_test/overseer_test.py`.
  - The preflight tests entry file is `tests/integration_test/preflight_check_test.py`.

### Test configuration

Each test configuration yaml define a whole FL system.
The `system_test.py` will read and parse the config to determine which `SiteLauncher` to use
to set up the whole system.

The test configuration yaml can be categorized 2 types, one is for Proof-Of-Concept (POC),
the other is for High-Availability (HA) mode:

1. Required attributes for POC-type test config:

| Attributes        | Description                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n_servers`       | Number of servers                                           |
| `n_clients`       | Number of clients                                           |
| `cleanup`         | Whether to clean up test folders or not. (Default to True.) |
| `jobs_root_dir`   | The directory that contains the job folders to upload       |
| `tests`           | The test cases to run                                       |

An example would be `tests/integration_test/data/test_configs/one_job/test_hello_numpy.yml`.

2. Required attributes for HA test config:

| Attributes      | Description                                                                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ha`            | Need to set to True for HA.                                                            |
| `project_yaml`  | The file that would be passed to NVFlare provision script to generate the startup kits |
| `poll_period`   | The polling period of `NVFTestDriver`. (Default to 5 seconds.)                          |
| `cleanup`       | Whether to clean up test folders or not. (Default to True.)                            |
| `jobs_root_dir` | The directory that contains the job folders to upload                                  |
| `tests`         | The test cases to run                                                                  |


An example would be `tests/integration_test/data/test_configs/authorization/list_job.yml`.

### Test cases

Each test case has the following attributes:

| Attributes            | Description                                                                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| test_name             | Name of this test case.                                                                    |
| event_sequence        | What events to run for this test case.                                                     |
| validators (optional) | Which validator to use to validate the running result once the event sequence is finished. |
| setup (optional)      | What shell command to run before this test case.                                           |
| teardown (optional)   | What shell command to run after this test case.                                            |


The most important part is "event_sequence", it will be trigger one by one.

After all events in event_sequence is triggered, then this test case is done.

We will explain in details in the following section.

An example test case is shown:

```yaml
  - test_name: "run hello-pt"
    event_sequence:
      - "trigger":
          "type": "server_log"
          "data": "Server started"
        "actions": [ "submit_job hello-pt" ]
        "result":
          "type": "run_state"
          "data": { }
      - "trigger":
          "type": "run_state"
          "data": { "run_finished": True }
        "actions": [ "ensure_current_job_done" ]
        "result":
          "type": "run_state"
          "data": { "run_finished": True }
    validators:
      - path: tests.integration_test.src.validators.PTModelValidator
      - path: tests.integration_test.src.validators.CrossValResultValidator
        args: { server_model_names: [ "server" ] }
    setup:
      - python -c "from torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10; CIFAR10(root='~/data', download=True)"
    teardown:
      - rm -rf ~/data

```

### Event sequence

Event sequence is consist of a list of events. 

Each event has the following attributes:

| Attributes | Description                                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| trigger    | When to perform the specified action.                   |
| actions    | What actions to take if the trigger is triggered.       |
| result     | What result to expect after these actions are finished. |

Each trigger has the following attributes:

| Attributes   | Description                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| type         | Specify the type of this trigger. |
| data         | The data of this trigger.         |

The following trigger type is supported:
  - server_log: triggered if the data can be found in server's log
  - client_log: triggered if the data can be found in client's log
  - server_job_log: triggered if the data can be found in server's job's log
  - client_job_log: triggered if the data can be found in client's job's log
  - run_state: triggered if the run state matched the data

Note that:

   `run_state` is based on predefined tracked state variables
    (workflow, task, round_number, run_finished etc.)

Each result has the following attributes:

| Attributes   | Description                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| type         | Specify the type of this result. |
| data         | The data of this result.         |

The following result type is supported:
  - run_state: check if current `run_state` match data.
  - admin_api_response: check if admin_api_response match data.
