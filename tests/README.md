# NVIDIA Flare Test


This file introduces how the tests in NVIDIA FLARE is organized.

We divide tests into unit test and integration test.

```commandline
tests:
  - unit_test
  - integration_test
```

## Unit Tests

### Structure

The structure of unit test is organized as parallel directories of the production code.

Each directory in `test/unit_test` is mapping to their counterparts in `nvflare`.

For example, we have `test/unit_test/app_common/job_schedulers/job_scheduler_test.py`
that tests `nvflare/app_common/job_schedulers/job_scheduler.py`.

### Run

To run unit test: `./runtest.sh`.

### Develop a test case

We use pytest to run our unit tests.
So please follow pytest test case style.

## Integration Tests

Please refer to [integration tests README](./integration_test/README.md).
